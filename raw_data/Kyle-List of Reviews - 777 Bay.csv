1,"Terrible service and I got charged $ 50 plus tax for an incorrect RRSP. I was not shown the transaction until it was completed so I could not see the error until after the fact. The  branch manager could care less about returning me the $ 50. Useless person. 
I have my investments in other banks and my only use of this branch is the ATM because it is very close to where I live."
1,"If you only want some simple service, withdrawing or depositing money, go ahead. Or you can easily get insulted by the so-called many year experience advisors as if she knew all the service details in all the banks across Canada. I had to remind her that I might not need it and just wanted to know more. Against her arrogance, I had to tell her that she might be right about TD, but I did not have to choose TD while the other banks gave me much better offers with less drama. They would not mind a hard inquiry on your credit, which hits your score, even they don't have to. Stay firm if you have to come here."
1,unprofessional
1,"Terrible branch, employees take breaks at whenever time and leave lines to grow before actually serving customers. Tellers are nowhere in sight and business services is the only one serving the 10 person line right now. Super unprofessional especially for such a busy location, employees don't even give eye contact, as if theyre trying to avoid you, would give 0 stars if possible."
1,"Horrible customer service. I had an unpleasant experience with two of them in a row. A complete disaster, they don't know how to service a customer, nor put a bit of effort to be polite. Try another branch, I would put zero star or negative number if I could."

1,"Such a rude and ignorant staff.  The system made a mistake on my account and the staff insisted it's my own responsibility to check and I should not come to this branch as he is not willing to help with this matter. I have to go far to the home branch to solve it.  I had this issue before that has been solved d in another closeby branch without any problem. 
This kinds of attitude just 'wows' me how bad the service is."
1,Long wait only to then be told by the teller that they weren‚Äôt qualified to carry out my request and that I‚Äôd have to queue up again to be seen by another teller.
1,Super slow service. Usually only a few tellers for a long lineup. Bring a book for the wait time.
1,"The worst experience at a branch since the past 8 years I've been with Td. Long wait times even when you've made an appointment, we requested the letter for Friday and went to pick it up on Monday. When we arrived, it was not ready, they clearly typed it up as we were waiting. The information in the letter is now out of date because they didn't complete when we asked for it. Might not seem like a big deal but this is for a visa application so it will cause us a lot of problems. Extremely unprofessional"

1,"This is definitely the worst branch to go to if you are a business. The staff are friendly but expect to be here for a LONG time. They only have one business teller which is right at the front with no actual line for it. Then they will have 5 or so for the consumer line. So while you're in line for business, consumers are walking by you as you're always in their way. Then others come in for business and stand in front of you as they don't realize you're in line. You literally wait 20 minutes for someone to deposit rolls of coins or pull out a stack of crumpled invoices in front of you. Last time I was here there were 3 of us in the business line and no one in line for consumer yet they had 5 tellers standing there. We are moving this week so luckily won't have to deal with this branch anymore, but definitely go elsewhere if you are a business and expect to be treated properly or valued."
1,"Tellers at this branch are rude and unprofessional. The teller(Mauran Thayalan) I talked to promised me I will be eligible for the Aeroplan infinite card after a hard credit check. Days later, he called and told me they don‚Äôt issue this card to students but I can apply for the infinite cash back, he lied about the benefits the card offers and convinced me to open that card. DISAPPOINTED!!! Be careful with this branch."
2,"Have yet to get good service here, one teller kept trying to convince me to try mobile cheque deposit repeatedly, and another wasn't able to determine why my debit card wouldn't work in the ATM (Bay/Queen figured it out)."
1,"I normally come here to do the money deposits for the business that I work for. I don't complain about going to the bank to do them because when my manager wants it done it has to be done. That being said I find it kind of hard to remain polite while I am dealing with the person behind the desk. For whatever reason when I show up instead a normal hello how are you, I get grilled about my life, how I live it and the choices I am making. At first I thought it was just normal customer services small talk, but now it just seems as if there is no boundaries the guy isn't willing cross to get information about me. I feel like I'm in a interrogation room instead of a bank waiting for the deposit to go through. I try to dodge a question by giving a pretty bland answer and instead of letting it go I 10 more questions. If I give in and answer properly that information is used against me. I don't like it. I'm not sure if that is how everyone is treated or if it's just me. Its not everyone who is like this. Most of the tellers are pretty normal about their interactions with me. My other co-workers don't go through this at all. This bank is close to my work, so I don't have to go far. However if this continues I'm just gonna have to take the business to a doffdiffe location."
1,WOW- UNPROFESSIONAL!!! I SPOKE TO THIS REP WHO HAVE NO COMMON SENSE TO BE ABLE TO HELP ME. REASON FOR ME TO SWITCH BANK.
1,Worst service I ever had with TD
5,Anthony deserves 5 star for sure. I appreciate his energy and helpfulness even though it's end of the week
5,Always had a great service
1,"Terrible service. Called in trying to setup an appointment to get help with my mutual funds account. The man asked if I was looking for my home branch, I said no, I just need help with my mutual funds account. He told me to 'hold on one second' and hung up. I tried to call back immediately several times and received the answering machine. This has helped me realize custoner oriented Credit Unions are a far better choice than big banks."
2,My girlfriend came in wanting to setup a TFSA came out being told she was going to be taxed on it so ended up setting a savings account with significantly lower return. Honestly a joke of an advisor. Rude tellers (hit or miss). Really had to tell one off today for beong rude as hell partially my fault for losing my cool. Despite iving next to this branch I do all my main banking at the one close to work now despite distance. Only come here to withdraw money. 2 stars for free coffee and updated TD machines
1,So bad communication. I don‚Äôt know how they can work there. I want they have responsibilities with this not only for money. I visited there to extend my Visa but it came up with serious problems by the TD worker who printed out handouts wrongly-.-
1,"Horrible service. I couldn't access my TD online bank account that I just opened last week. I called TD and they told me I needed to go to a branch with two piece of ID because I didn't receive client card yet. An agent at the branch told me that my account was compromised and asked me to call TD to resolve it. I called again and I was told yet another time that they couldn't handle either because I didn't have my client card. They instructed me to go to a branch and ask the staff there to call them on my behalf. The agent at the branch knew I didn't have my client card and should have helped me call instead of just giving me a number. This series of events leaves me a very bad impression on TD, a so-called client-centric bank."
1,"Terrible service, the lady helping me literally forgot for a month about my case. She blamed me and said I never emailed her about it but I emailed her twice and she never responded. There have been so many mistakes made, I have another branch helping me deal with this branch."

1,The manager jerry is condescending and rude and so is the manager Jane .. they pay you no mind like ur not a customer talk down to you and don‚Äôt value ur business. Typical gay Canadian condescending rude and patronizing. Horrible customer service try another branch nearby
1,"Worst customer service ever. Spoke with one of their staff who said she can't help me with what i'm looking for, and that i have to leave a message for the person who can answer my question. I left a message and got a call back from one of their branch reps who said he has many requests and he can't look up mine by name or card and i have to stop by their branch to check the status of my request in person, he then said he found my request and it has been processed, i asked why they haven't called me back to let me know as i was told that, he said ""I don't know"". I asked if I can pick up my request at a different branch, he said ""oh i don't know, but you can try"". Well if you don't know, what are you doing there?? I honestly felt like this rep. is someone who just walked into the branch with no clue whatsoever and was asked to take this call!"
1,"Well.. I can‚Äôt make a comment on other staffs I believe there are a lot of nice and professional people in this branch There is a white guy, around 50Ôºålooks like a manager or something He just made me feel really unwelcomed, when I asked some question (may sounds stupid) he is impatient and showed me some classic fake smile : ) not friendly at all.. maybe because he is a manager whatever"
1,don't bank here if you're queer :(
5,"One of the BEST TD üè¶ branches downtown Toronto near the entrance to the College Park complex. Clean well run branch, friendly and courteous tellers. Line moves fast! üèß ATM machine. TorontoLocalGuide review."

2,"Staff are adequately friendly, but the wait times are significantly longer than all the other TD branches i frequent at all hours of the day and there never seems to be enough people working.  "
3,Very friendly staff but they seem to be insufficiently trained.
5,Busy Branch but professional employees
3,Branch close to core but their ATM machine frequently causes issues with card/ cash getting stuck
1,The worst TD brunch the manger he has his own rolls bad costumer service I wish I can rate it less thin one star
1,"This TD branch is the most inefficient, unhelpful branch I have ever experienced. My most recent unpleasant experience with them happened five days ago, when I went there to ask for a standard recommendation letter for an apartment rental application. It is over 12 years I am with TD and I have several accounts with tens of thousands dollars savings and investments but like any sane person I keep the minimum required money in my chequing account. The lady at the help desk directed me to the manager of the branch (or someone who was in charge of the actual manager). To my surprise he told me that the only thing he would write in the recommendation form would be the amount in my chequing. Less than an hour before that I was at RBC and the nice assistant there, without me even asking her, wrote me the total amount of my assets with RBC. I told it to the TD branch manager and he, in a relatively rude manner, told me he was not comfortable doing that. I asked him if instead of writing the total amount of my assets he could simply write the information about the account with maximum investment in it (that has been there for several years now) and he said he could not. I asked him not to fill out the form. Took it back and went to the TD branch at Bay and Bloor where the friendly staff did precisely what RBC staff had done for me, without even me asking him to do so (that means it is something standard, at least is not unjust). He also gave me a certified print out of brief history I have with TD, confirming that I have been a long term trustworthy client. I am happy that this nonsense policy that used in Bay-College is not TD's overall policy, but I am very disappointed at the branch at Bay and College by having such unhelpful (in its best interpretation) staff there. It is also worth mentioning that this was not the only non-pleasant experience I have had with this TD branch. Long line ups are normal in certain hours especially for branches at main intersections, but after waiting in those lines, having unfriendly faces and staff who shoot you to each other for simple tasks -those that other branches do quickly and hassle-free for the clients- means this branch needs a real investigation by TD, if they want to keep their clients happy."
2,"Friendly staff. However, they cannot perform their job well. Messy handwriting and they spelled my name completely wrong."
1,"Just a caution to everyone: the staff here are unprofessional, not properly trained and makes serious errors. I went to deposit a large amount cheque and the customer service rep and the customer service manager both failed to negotiate the cheque correctly. The amount they deposited to my account did not match the amount on the cheque. This happened two weeks ago and the issue is still not resolved. Truly shocking that people with insufficient training is allowed to handle our money! I can understand and tolerate occasional errors from a customer service rep but a manager who fails to read the correct amount on a cheque is somewhat disturbing. Please check your transaction receipt carefully if you decide to visit this branch."

5,"i went late afternoon today, as usual it was very busy and quite a bit of a wait to see the teller, but i would like to comment on how lovely the customer service was, whilst in line and at the teller. there were employees who walked along the people waiting in line asking individually if they could be of any service, though most of us had to deposit or withdraw money. they were very polite and this helped speed up the wait a little bit. once i was at the teller, the man who helped me was very kind and cheerful. all the employees seemed happy and patient, even though it was busy. great customer service at this branch, i would definitely be visiting again!"
