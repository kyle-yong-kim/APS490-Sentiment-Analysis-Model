1,Very unprofessional staffs and supervisor. I went there this morning and I was on the line and suddenly a Chinese background lady come From Nowhere and jumped into the cashier I told the cashier that he had to follow the clients that are on the line and he even look at me and apologized he just focussed and service the lady that was his same background. So I asked another cashier I wanted to talk with the supervisor and the supervisor told the another cashier she was very busy to see me . Besides that another lady from inside the bank was looking at me making me face because I wanted to make a complaint. I wondering how long TD bank will keep their client with personal like that working on its facilities.
1,"Here are 3 reasons TD is the worst bank for small businesses, based on my experience!

1- when I contacted TD to open a 3rd business account, I found out that they do not have my business information filed correctly, and items submitted are now missing from my file. These include vital business docs like my articles of incorporation.

2- I would expected that after escalating my issue to head office, and also provided missing documents, I've no more problems & get the account opened. But no, it took more than 2 weeks and my issue remains unresolved, and I haven't received an update in 5 days.Which makes me wonder, do they even care?

3- Throughout more than 7 interaction with TD employees I have found that they have not taken any responsibility for the error in losing my corporate documents, no one has even acknowledged the error. Yes, we all make mistakes, but I will not continue to work with a business that can't take ownership of their mistakes"

He knew that I needed to expedite my situation so I was connected right away to the TD Branch Manager, Pat who was patient, understanding and quite knowledgeable. Pat had my situation resolved within our conversation. Incredible customer service from this Branch...they went above and beyond the call of duty! Highly recommend this Branch :)"
2,"I sat down with ROSA last week to open a direct investment account. At first I was happy because she had time to see me without an appointment. But when we sat down, I noticed she didn’t have a very friendly attitude, probably because I told her I don’t want to open a mutual fund account. As I recently became a PR, she told me my SIN has to be changed in order to open a DI account, but having my new SIN was not enough. She specifically asked me to bring the SIN paper issued by Service Canada and booked another appointment for me with someone else. I mean, if the TD website says I can change my SIN by calling a rep on the phone, the rep definitely can’t see my paper. Why would having my IDs, my SIN number and my presence not enough??? What value would that paper add? It’s so obvious that she did not want to provide service to me after hearing my NO to mutual funds and not seeing a big number in my account. Please, have some professional integrity."
1,Bad service
1,"Went in for a credit limit increase. Gave me the run around and made me submit an application.. its been almost 3 months haven't heard a word back from them or the advisor who ""helped"" me. I've been a customer for over 10 years now."
5,"This branch always looks busy. During their business time, there are so many tellers including two specially for their business customers. There is a help desk which I found has been very helpful when needed. There are 4 ATMs. What shocked me seeing an Amazon pickup machine for packages!"
1,Worst branch I have ever used. Slow service and rude uninformed employees. I've had an account with TD for 17 years and this location has been by far the absolute most unhelpful and literally RUDE people I have ever had to deal with.
5,"Very nice branch. Any time I go there I get the best service. Today I needed some help paying some bills. It was a guy named Angus. Very nice guy, professional , humble and willing to explain things."
5,Easy to access location

5,"One of the best TD locations I've frequented. The staff is always friendly, remembers me and conversations we've had in the past, and is always overly apologetic even for minor wait times (including during busy hours when it is clearly not their faults). I wish I wasnt so terrible with remembering names or I would call out specific staff for their great customer service, but I hope this is passed on to the whole teM regardless."
4,"I really like the staff here. They don't know everything, but ask a supervisor for assistance when needed. I have been to 4 different tellers and they have all be polite, courteous and willing to help."
1,Currently standing in line waiting for service. It is 1230 and there is one teller. Person standing at door greeting people when they could be a teller. Only have to come once a month but dread coming. When will it ever change?
1,Worst customer service.Staff didn’t have enough information.She didn’t even really try to help me.so I said I want to see supervisor but supervisor was so rude she just left while I’m talking with her. It’s just horrible store. I wish if I can give them 0 star
3,Long wait to speak to the teller
5,"Really so nice employee,good service, and this location help me alot"
1,Wow! These guys are slower than turtles. And they don’t give a damn!
1,"Worst experience ever (I almost never write bad reviews for anyone). First the teller appeared to have extremely limited knowledge about banking. And then there is this one financial advisor Ashley, who had an extremely sh*tty attitude, she clearly did not know how to treat the customer respectfully, how to make the customer feel comfortable, nor how to build trust with the customer. In the end they tried to trick me into investing my money for something that they can benefit from, job performance or commission or whatever it is. The whole experience just couldn’t get any worse."
1,"Disclosing business information aloud, such as credit card number, pin on back while calling into their hotline, while other customers are around, to do an inquiry. Very unprofessional."

2,"Really disappointed with the help desk customer service. I called to make an appointment to see a mortgage consultant as I wanted to cash the surplus in my property tax account. I was told I didn't need an appointment and the help desk was able to facilitate this paper work for me. After taking time from work to go to the branch I was told by the same person that I needed an appointment and unfortunately they weren't able to make anyone available on that day. I wasn't satisfied with the way it was unfolding and she was becoming increasingly rude despite her own mistake. More unfortunately when she contacted her manager, she sided with the staff and also was short with me. I can't help but think if I was opening a mortgage instead of closing one and closing an account, this may have been handled differently. These two personalities really tainted my experience."
