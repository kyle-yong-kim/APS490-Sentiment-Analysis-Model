5,"I received exceptional TD service at this branch from Deyvis. The branch did not have any tellers like the usual TD, and I thought we were at a wrong place. Despite our confusion, Deyvis offered to help us with some complex account closure and making joint accounts without an appointment. He was super friendly and was so very upbeat changing our boring banking needs to a fun and pleasant time. He did talk a bit fast and really knew what he was talking. Although I did not have a problem with that as I am also strong with numbers and accounting, for someone who is not so knowledgeable might find it difficult to understand the first time. Overall, the best TD experience I had so far."
1,"My appointment with Deyvis Fernandez was horrendous. I needed to open a certain account for which I had to go in person. That's all I needed to do. Very simple. If I could have done it online I would have. When I arrived, in order to make small talk, I mentioned that it is cooler outside than in the branch. He replied, ""That's because you just came in from outside""! I should have gone back out the door at that point. Deyvis had difficulty understanding what I wanted. When he misunderstood he blamed me for ""changing my mind"" which is absurd. He also kept trying to push a ""financial advisor"" on me even thought I kept saying I don't want that. He sat across the table from me smirking. I don't need an adversary, just someone to give me the papers to open the simple account. He had various cutesy names for me, such as Missus Karen. At the end of the meeting he began pushing for the financial advisor again, even though I had told him repeatedly no. Just abysmal. An absolute disgrace. Update: I had told him at the appointment that I believed the form he gave me to sign was the wrong one. I explained to him why it was the wrong form. He sat there stupidly. I filled out the form, hoping that maybe it would turn out to be the right account. Turns out it wasn't! Now I have to go for yet another appointment, obviously not with him."
1,"Completed documents to open a new TD Direct account and left them at this branch, to be forwarded to TD Direct. Two weeks later, the branch hadn't done anything with them. I got the run around about the TD Direct liaison not being in the branch. No idea what that has to do with them sitting there for two weeks. Next I drop off POA, branch person checked over what is an awful form (written by lawyers for lawyers), sent it to TD Direct. TD Direct sent it back to this branch a week ago, but hasn't contacted me. TD Direct is fine once you get things set up, but on-boarding is painful and this branch is sleepy hollow and incompetent."
2,I went to pick up credit card after getting a call from this branch. The rep couldn’t find it for an hour b/c someone misplaced it. I’m not letting some people who cant even organize a simple thing like that to advise and manage my money and accounts. Super unprofessional and inconvenient. They were nice though i guess.
5,"Amazing branch. They have top notch customer service and everyone out there is always smiling and welcoming. They don't have tellers which makes the branch unique and quite so they can focus only on investment, mortgage, and other day to day banking.. must visit the branch"
4,"This is NOT a full branch. There are no tellers and cash cannot be dispensed here. However there are high tech ATMs where both CAD and USD can be bought. This branch is staffed exclusively with various advisors etc. but no tellers. However bank drafts and *some* other instruments can be obtained here (call first). That being said it is a nice branch, a bit small but very new. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and fortunately I was able to get my business completed here despite it not being a full branch. If you conduct your daily banking business online and need to make investments, move funds or make a last minute RRSP contribution; this is the branch for you."
1,Extremely unprofessional and unskillfull financial advisors I have ever met!
3,This is not a branch. ATM and advice only. Went to do a wire transfer and unable to. They were nice though.
5,Absolutely wonderful experience! This beach has no tellers just advisers. They have a USD ATM as well. Staff is very good and friendly.

2,"Cashless branch', this branch has ATMs but the tellers cannot offer you cash. I went in to get USD cash and was unable to."

1,This is NOT a branch of the bank. There are no tellers and no way to do day-to-day banking except for ATMs.

5,"I usually don't write reviews but this is an exception. I would like to thank Luca from this mill street branch for his exceptional service. I love the extended hours that td has vs some other banks but even then I find myself very busy with my career. I acquired his business card not too long ago when I found the time to stumble on in. I didn't get to speak with him too much as I was in a hurry but first impressions were very good. Tonight, I found myself really struggling with td easy web as I'm not very tech savvy. As I was pulling out my access card from my wallet I noticed his business card. At this point I was so frustrated and didn't have the patience to call an easy line. I gave it a shot and called him at 9 pm. We spoke on the phone for almost an hour as he walked me step by step through easy web. I'm not sure if this is something Luca does often but in my eyes I don't really care. This is customer service at its finest. I would also like to thank management at this branch for developing such a big asset to your team. Like I said I'm usually a review spectator but now I know what it feels like to be on the other side. Kind regards."
