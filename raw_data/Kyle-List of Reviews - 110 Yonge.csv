5,"Pleasantly surprised with the attention received from branch manager (pulling few other employees too) to help with a tricky RESP setup/changes. Top rate service!
Ps: came with no appointment  either."
5,Normally very unimpressed with the service received at TD branches (looking at you 161 Bay) but I need to call out bank teller Cody and his manager (didn't catch her name) for phenomenal customer service this morning. After a terrible experience at 161 Bay I was wondering if I'd made a mistake choosing TD as my mortgage and primary banking provider but Cody and his manager restored my faith. Thank you x1000000 for genuinely caring and working with me to do some creative problem solving to make things work out on a tight timeline. Much appreciated!
1,Sucks
1,"probably 15 people wait in line, both personal and business. only 3 tellers available and service speed very very very very very slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good customer service
2,"Poor service, does not pay attention to customer needs."
3,"Customer service is generally fine, but there are probably 15 people in line, and only 3 tellers.... kind of weird considering how big this location is and the fact that it's nearly Christmas... And Wednesday at 3:45pm. Maybe... Maybe staff your branches accordingly?"
1,The most unprofessional and unreliable staff. For the last 1.5 year had three unpleasant experiences.
1,"God awful service. Came in to ask about a status of a approved a line of credit. Was told by the branch manager that it's not her problem cause I applied at a different branch so I should go talk to a different branch manager. I bank with TD not with individual branch managers. The epitomy of ""not my problem"" approach to customer service. Stay clear of this branch."
5,Superfast service
1,"Disappointing. I had received notice of a significant rate increase on my unsecured line of credit, after which it would be a little over 4% above prime. I was a bit irked by this and so enquired through TD's website (EasyWeb) to see if anything could be done about the increase, seeing as how I was a 30+ year customer of bank and they had the bulk of my banking, investment, mortgage and insurance business. They indicated I would need to go to a branch and made an appointment for me at this branch. So I go to the branch and the gentleman proceeds to inform me that it's a bank-wide increase and unfortunately there's nothing they can do about it. Oh, and how the rate I had was actually quite competitive. No other suggestions, no offers, no discussion. Perplexed, I ask why they didn't just say this when responding to my message through their (secured) website or even over the phone, rather than having me come in only to tell me that. He indicated that he thought my preference would be to discuss such matters in person. I thought it was quite kind of him to advise me of what my preference was. Thanked him for his time and left. The following day, I called another bank and had a verbal offer for an unsecured line of credit for twice the amount at prime + 0.5%. I'm signing the paperwork tomorrow and now contemplating moving the rest of my affairs to the other bank."
5,"Only went in here once, and it was pretty big and spacious. The staff member that was helping me was really friendly and energetic. Really talkative and drives the conversation."
5,"My experience there was great the teller I had was the most friendly I've ever had, so sweet."
1,They just want you to get out of bank. Workers here need to understand the meaning of customer service. Disappointed with just this branch
1,"I’ve always prized myself on my ability to spin a word. However, the following requires no spinning, no literary device save for cold brutal honesty. I am disappointed. A month ago there were charges made against my account that resulted in NSF fees being charged 8 (eight) times to my account. To clarify and remedy the abnormality, I contacted my bank, then the party responsible for accidentally billing me repeatedly. I haven’t had problems with TD in the past. If there were trivialities, customer service was quick and to the point and always friendly. This time, however, was not the case. I visited the Yonge and Adelaide branch in Toronto, trying to sort the mess out. I approached a lady dressed in blue, passed a friendly greeting and asked if I could speak with her briefly. She had her arms folded (body language speaks volumes), looked at me, and said go ahead. I explained the situation and she cut off me mid sentence, pointed to the line and said I have to speak with the teller and then I can ask for a manager. I work in customer service. In fact, I run a clothing store that thrives off of it. And if someone approached me, and I did the same thing that she did, and in the manner that she did, I would be written up. I would write myself up. I would probably fire myself and find a job that did not involve being friendly to people. But she was just the beginning. I nod and move towards the line and after a brief exchange with the teller, another manager is called, who thankfully does not cut me off, like the manager in blue, but refuses to accommodate the simple request that these charges be alleviated, or at least, some sort of a compromise be made where I can pay for 1 or 2 of those charges. After half an hour of back and forth I’m told to speak with the branch manager, Mr. Ahmad Ali, who wasn’t there and I was required to wait until the next business day. The following day, he simply gives me a number to call and says there’s nothing more he can do. I have banked with TD for 5 years, my family has banked with TD for nearly 20 years. After this experience and the lack of favour shown to loyal clients, and abysmal service standards, you realise why I don’t care to bank with you anymore. I am disappointed. I am disgusted."
5,"My experiences here are good. They helped me sort out a problem my home branch couldn't explain. Always friendly, and apologetic after hearing about my prior issues. They work quickly to try and get you out the door."

5,BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD. MS. LAMBE WENT FAR AND BEYOND TO HELP ME ON HER LUNCH HOUR. I WILL BE SWITCHING MY ACCOUNT TO THIS BRANCH.
4,extensive facilities and was very well attended.
1,"Terrible customer service. They asked me several personal questions which I answered correctly, and even after I gave them my sin number they still asked for more ID to make a simple money draft. Go elsewhere for service."
1,"Went to this branch about a week ago and had a terrible experience. I went to make a transfer from my account; was asked for photo ID, only for them to say my address is incorrect. They then said that the managers are very strict and require photo ID with matching address, but my address should be up to date (I get mail)! They proceeded to ask my to say my social insurance number out loud to confirm my identity. I almost felt scammed now that I think about it. I then went to the Markham branch on highway 7 and Kennedy with my passport in hand, expecting the same terrible service. Instead it was incredibly good there, and they confirmed my address and information are 100% correct. I recommend to do your business elsewhere, such as the Markham branch. I still very much enjoy TD, but will never go to the Yonge and Adelaide branch again."
5,The customer service was exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful
1,"Terrible, Terrible customer service! In particular the managers. Have been there many times and they never want to help anyone, always turning people away frustrated. I hate this branch!! Morons!!!"

1,Can someone please give these fools some customer service lessons ? Worst customer service ever. Rude and stuck up employees.

5,"They have a coin counting machine that's free for TD customers, and a little cheaper than Coin Star for non-customers. "
