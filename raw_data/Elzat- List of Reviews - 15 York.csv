5,"Excellent Branch. The one girl who is excellent has been there for years and she is so funny and so nice. She is Gold!.... I tired them for my Business after having issues with RBC and now I have everything with TD, this branch is excellent. Great People!"
5,"I enjoy going to this branch - I consistently found the bank tellers to be friendly, down to earth, helpful, and professional. I really appreciate the genuine nature and the feeling of community when I interact with the tellers here. It's refreshing to have my business handled efficiently and with great customer service. I hope the staff are being recognized and rewarded for their customer service because it goes a long way in customer retention."
5,Let me start by saying that I have been a TD customer for 25 years. This is the best TD branch I have ever visited as far as service goes. They are friendly and efficient. It's a pleasure to deal with this branch
5,"Excellent, quick and friendly customer care... really happy with the TD team in there... well done and keep it up."
5,Staff at this branch were very helpful when I had to sort out an issue with my TD Bank US account (phone access to US account had been frozen after someone called impersonating me).
5,The best customer service I’ve had at a bank.
1,"Poor customer service, didn't even try to help. I have opened accounts and done business with this branch before but they wouldn't even help when I asked to withdraw money for lunch because I forgot my wallet"
1,"Poor customer service and no respect to the customer. I've been to many TD branches this is the worst one. The staff was very impatient and kept on interrupting me to show that she understood my request. Then she figured out she needed to get another staff to help me. The worst is that I was parked on the sofa and the other staff never came over. they could have done much better. When I went to other TD branch for same business, they understood my requirements right away and worked on it."
5,Had a nice experience with the teller here a few weeks ago.
1,This might possibly be the worse branch I have ever visited. Went there today to do a simple a transaction. They couldn’t have been less helpful or less concerned with serving their customers. TD needs to take a serious look at the staff and culture at this location.
3,"Efficient and convenient for often-asked requests like deposits and withdrawals. A bit of a hit or miss for other requests. I went in to get a certified copy of a receipt today and the lady ended up stamping the original. To be safe, I will have to request the receipt reissued."

4,"Nice friendly staff!! Conveniently located, they only problem is that you can't access the ATM from inside the mall after regular operation hours of the bank!!"
