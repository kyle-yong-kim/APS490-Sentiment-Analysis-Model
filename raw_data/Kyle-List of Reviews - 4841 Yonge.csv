5,"Professionalism and high efficiency is what I look for when banking, thus Eric will definitely be my go-to guy at this TD branch. Very pleasant young man, pleased with his service and knowledge"
5,This is a great location. The team are super friendly! Branch Manager and Management Team go above and beyond to make us feel welcome and part of the family. They do listen and value our input. Highly Recommend!
1,"Very disappointed experience in this branch, Manager there is extremely lazy and inpatient, this branch can’t even verify a money order, how terrible it is, most terrible banking experience in my life. Please close this branch and let the staff go for training."
1,I can't remember her exact name but Shald or Shala was so rude and seemed new. She needs to be trained more for the customer service
1,Very slow service... slower than turtle...

1,This is the only branch that doesn’t ’t fax drafts to verify. So disappointing.

1,"I would have give them negative stars if I can. My experience here happen in the morning around 830AM... Slowest service of my life. I was the next person in line, trying to get change waited in line for 10 minutes there were only 2 tellers. After 1 of them was done she was just taking her time... Seems like she refused to serve me for some reasons. And the other line was apparently business service but I was supposed to be in line first there was also another lady behind me and the person that came 3rd...guess what?? They got service before me??! What's the point of lining up when they get the priority before I was the next in line. Save yourself troubles. Go to another TD bank where they actually will get you better services. What's the point of building a newer TD bank when your customers service is getting worst?"

1,"TD should have closed this branch so useless! Aeroplan® Visa Platinum is my first product with TD and Im having troubled registering for easy web. TD call center told me to visit TD branch to get a code then I went to visit this branch at Yonge&Sheppard March 29. Service was bad. I was told to wait and many employees were just chatting themselves. No line up and only 1 person helping 1 customer. After a while, I decided to walk away. They certainly don't value my business. Looks like closing my card is in order."
1,"The worst TD Branch ever. This morning, I was poorly treated by the teller who made mistake on depositing my cheque to the wrong account. He would rather blame me than admit it and say a sorry."
5,"I met with Stefan, the Assistant Branch Manager at this location and let me tell you he went above and beyond to help me. I had an issue where the payment account for which my automatic purchase into my Mutual Funds was set up in error from another branch. I walked in the branch he greeted me as soon as i walked into the branch and offered to meet with me right away.He addressed all my needs and ensured the corrections were made and the proper accounts were set up. In addition he took the time to provide me advice about my banking and made sure i was in the right plans as well as my investments.The Team at this branch are extremely friendly and are always a happy bunch willing to help!"

5,Fastest atm!
2,Wait times are way to long at this branch. There is no sense of urgency from any of the tellers to make sure the line moves smoothly. They constantly are chatting and taking their time. Have waited upwards of 30 min to see a teller with only 3 people in front of me in line.
1,"The worst bank ever..The front desk employee today was so lazy, unfriendly and rude!She asked me for ID in able to get my CC I took out in my bag and then she walked out and waited for her like forever! Don’t go here! Horrible bank!"
1,"I went there several times. Once I found that the person supposed to meet me actually went home. They did not ask another person to help me. Instead, they asked me to go home and reschedule the appointment. This branch is definitely the worst among all the TD branches after comparison."
2,"Slow, confused and disorganized employees.
Business services window's location poorly  planned."

1,Slowest TD bank in the world. Been waiting 30 mins and only had 2 ppl in front of me never again will I use this bank
4,Its good td customers support is always excellent
5,like this location a lot. helpful like Lin

1,"Not impressed with this branch. Long lines, few tellers working. Lots of employees standing around and talking. My partner was trying to get a new credit card limit and they messed up or lost the paperwork two times. Thankfully CIBC was able to keep track of
Her paperwork and her new card is with them. Avoid this branch if you want competent service IMO. Stick to the ATM machines here."
5,This branch has always been helpful

1,So upset about the service at this location. There is a Korean guy staff who is so rude . I went there for some clarification for my account. He was lack of patience and training. He keeps shouting at me said I don’t understand you issue. And then I ask to speak to the manager who is ready to be communicate with. I can not believe this is how they treat their customer. Especially I am talk to him with a good manner. This is why I write my story here. Be aware of those people!
3,"I gave them a call, they didn't pick up so i left a message. Never called back. Edit: I gave this 1 star before but now it's 3 stars because I went and got the business done right away thanks to Zahen Shaknuza even though they never called."
1,"Unresponsive, disorganized service."
1,terrible service
1,"Beach manager is extremely rude, she talk irresponsibly and deliver the wrong information to customer regards credit card details, dont even recommend me to contact the td credit card centre to confirm the info. Staff member are lack of training, unfamiliar with lots of service related questions,Worst place be aware!"

1,"Summary : don't go here. Zero stars. Went to deposit a large USD cheque here and since I didn't have a USD account the teller converted it to Canadian immediately. The cheque ended up  bouncing due to nsf and funds needed to be removed from my account . However I lost a material amount of money on the conversion to remove the usd funds which I didn't have  from my account so they took cad equivalent value. I asked why they cashed a cheque that large before confirming funds were available because now I'm out a significant amount of money. Was told some bs excuse that it's the writers fault not the bank's and they can't use the same exchange rate to remove the funds that they did when putting the money into my account, which would have erased the transaction completely. I had to use market rates which were surprise surprise unfavorable to me. I spoke to another branch manager that said that amount of money should have went to clearing so a situation like this doesn't happen and funds should not have been made available immediately. Moral of the story - go to a different branch that knows what they're doing."
3,Umm... the staff was counting the bills until she forgot where she was at..

1,Very nasty people. They tricked me twice and made me lost so much money. If I have time I will bring them on court. Very very bad people.

5,Very busy bank on weedays.. Good service by bank professionals . Line moves fast.
1,"Lying Staff, Horrible Manager, I have banked with these douchebags for 13 years and got nothing. I am switching to BMO. Disgusting Customer Service. They look like Money Mart and act like a bank."
5,I'm not sure why there are negative reviews.  TD overall is pretty good and this branch is exceptional.  The construction in the mall is an annoyance but it's hardly TD's fault.

1,"Horrible customer service. I did my credit card application with Mohamed Ahmed, and it seems like he doesn't know how to use a phone. He was supposed to contact me because there was a problem with my application. Does not call. So I call him to find out that the application went through. I wait for the credit card in my mail, but it does not get delivered. I visit the branch again to find out what is going on. Apparently there is another problem that has occurred and only Mohamed can take a look at it. I wait for him because he was with another client. He does not show up for about half an hour and sends his coworker who just throws documents in my face telling me to sign it and leave without any explanation. I said I needed some explanation, but his coworker keeps on saying ""I do not know anything Mohamed sent me to give this document to you to sign it"". I kept on asking for the explanation and he goes on to say ""okay don't sign it. just wait for Mohamed then"" giving me an attitude. I wait another 15 minutes and finally get into Mohamed's office. He says everything has been resolved and I just need to sign this document one last time and submit the application again. He said this will take at most 24 hours but it will probably be right away. He also promised to contact me as soon as he gets an answer from the credit department. I wait another day for his call and still nothing. I call him. He does not pick up. I call him again. Does not pick up. I call the front desk and ask to speak to Mohamed Ahmed. Front desk person tells me he is finishing up with a client and is able to take the call. Front desk transfers me to Mohamed. Still does not pick up the phone. I get upset and go into the branch again. I finally speak with him and he tells me everything is all good. I ask him why he didn't contact me or pick up my phone call. He first replied that he told me he was going to contact me if something went wrong (which is a lie) and I kept questioning him and he admitted that he was supposed to contact me but he was overwhelmed with his work. He then goes on to ask me if i want to cancel the application....He I had to visit the branch four times over the six week period and still haven't gotten my credit card yet. This branch is composed of unprofessional individuals and I am disappointed by their horrible customer services."

1,"This branch is completely composed with unprofessional staff. I booked an appointment    today from 1pm to 2pm to unlocked my online banking and open few more accounts. When I arrived at 1pm, I was told to wait because nobody was available despite my appointment booking. After 25 minutes, nobody was still available for my booking. When I was upset and complaint about this, I was refused the service. Why there is an appointment bookings when no one is available for it . Completely rude and unprofessional staff! Shame!"
4,"I worked with them for a while, okay"
1,I went all the way here to transfer money but they were closed on Sunday. Should correct the information!!!
4,"It's been a while that work with TD, they are ok "
5,"Think about the nature of leaving a review. It is typically a reaction to something, either love or hate. No one ever writes a service review if it met expectations, but marginally. 

My reaction to their service, as good as to be expected and as good as it has always been with TD. I like TD as a bank, I like their service."
3,"Judging from the equal number of opposing reviews, I can only suggest that some people are either too demanding or too relaxed in their expectations."
5,excellent customer service. I didn't know how to use a deposit book and the teller taught me step by step how to do so. excellent. thanks!
1,Horrible service. The manager on the floor was lazy
1,"Of all the TD branches I've been to this one is the worst. They always gave me wrong info and it always takes me at least 2 trips to the branch to get one simple task done, such as updating my application info or setting up password. They always told me they can't do the task for me and I'll have to do that over the phone, but then the agent on the phone will tell me to go back to the branch. It's not just the staff, but the manager as well. Terrible service, absolutely incompetent."
5,"TD is an excellent bank, and I have always loved this branch. Ali Rishid and Marvin are both excellent managers, and everyone is always very helpful!!!"
