1,"Not only were they under staffed on a Thursday afternoon, one teller was casually speaking with a customer about non banking matters for the entirety of my 15 minute wait then the teller that I did see was very rude and condescending. He claimed that I needed to verify my identity, even though i entered my pin correctly, first I’m hearing of this even though I’ve been a customer for years. I did end up providing my ID with protest, then he claimed he still wasn’t satisfied for some reason and had to talk to the manager who hilarious brushed him off and he returned with my withdrawal. Like if I was doing something nefarious I would have pulled money from an ATM instead of going in. Tellers name was maddie or maddle"
1,Dealing with these people was worse than pulling teeth. Nobody could do anything for themselves and I thus ended up having to wait for them to call a head office just to be told that I needed to speak to a manager. Utter waste of time and resources.
1,"i have been with td a long time and have had nothing but problems, keep wanting to hold my cheques and rude staff, and very discriminatory. i noticed this at alot of toronto locations... i am closing my account finally"
3,"The employees at this branch are nice, but I've never been to a TD location that is so ridiculously slow. No matter what time of day I go, there are never enough tellers working and you always have to wait. Go to another branch if you're in a rush."
5,"As business clients, we have always received outstanding service from this branch. The tellers are not only kind, but also care about customer satisfaction. Particularly, the branch manager Emre is very client oriented, professional and willing to assist in any manner. It is true that some clients feel connected to their banks thanks to these special people and their dedication."
5,Thank you Nishteman for the wonderful banking experience in this TD branch!
1,"This bank is the most rudest place ive been in , i went to open a chequing account on Tuesday July 9 2019, as i walked in, was greeted my a gentleman that asked if he could help, i told him what i was there for & told me to take a seat & somebody would be there in 5 minutes. After about 20 minutes another gentleman came and saw my I.D on the table , notice that i had a picture ohip card & asked if i had any other photo id & i said no , i dont drive & i dont travel. He look at me as if i was from another planet and told me they dont accept ohip as id then told me to leave , just like that. No please or sorry but just leave. So if you are thinking of opening a account there DON'T"
5,The service team here is amazing. I've worked with just about everyone at this branch to date and I've never had any issues with them.
5,"Get friendly service and staff. It's not my home branch, but they treat me as if it was my home branch. Thanks for making me feel at home."
1,"This is my home branch, I am not at all satisfied. Recently I tried to deposit bank draft (also Issued by a TD bank) to my personal account and It took them couple hours to verify the draft. My point is its not a cheque, its a bank draft and also issued by TD bank, why it take hours to get funds available. I had to wait at branch to withdraw funds."

1,The worst TD bank I have ever been to in my life and I have been to multitude of locations as a TD card holder for almost two decades. This bank is super slow consisting of incompetent tellers with awful managers. Do NOT go here unless you want to wait in line for a long time and want to waste more time waiting for unintelligent employees to do their basic jobs. This review is based on three visits and I will never go there ever again knowing that past incidents were not circumstantial.
1,Extremely slow service
5,Great service

1,"I am writing this review to warn others as well to vent about this branch.

This branch is as many reviews say very nice staff but extremely slow service with a lack of tellers. 

Basically in short I wouldn’t suggest go to this branch unless you want your pay cheque to be held. I personally try to avoid it because on two previous account I’ve had problems here. 

On one account a few years back I deposited a pay cheque walked across the street to the Tim Horton’s where my card was then declined confused I go back to the TD to ask the teller who I deposited the cheque with what happened, only for to smile and apologize informing me she forgot to deposit it; that left a bad taste in my mouth so I stayed away. Though it is conveniently located to the TTC station I eventually returned after sometime, where again very friendly staff but slow service where upon depositing my cheque from a work I had been work at for 3 years now and having priorly signing a TD form about my work to help prevent holds on paycheque from my employer; with a similar if not smaller amount than normal being deposited I was told it was being verified. Mind you at the time I was in high school so I thought nothing of it’s, it should be noted I didn’t have any issues with any other branch prior or onwards about the validity of my pay cheque or releasing the whole balance immediately. 

But come yesterday June 22, 2018 at roughly 4:30pm I returned to this branch where again friendly staff with a smile but slow service. I was sent to the business teller as there was only 2 tellers working prior. I insert my debit card, everything is good, present him my pay cheque which is dated to be cashed 5 days ago. The teller struggles with his computer then tells me he has to verify it, taking it to his manger I found that unusual as the pay cheque was half of what I normally deposited, they speak he comes back tells me he just had to verify it, I reply ""oh yea don’t you use the cheque machine you see at other TD branch where they place the cheque in  the machine and it slide it through"" he replies ""the computer does it"", I say nothing as I’m not sure what the cheque machine was and if it even verifies anything or is just counting how many cheques a teller gets a shift. Anyways he ask me if their is anything else he can do, I say I’ll take $40 he gets me the money I asked him out of curiosity ""why this branch has trouble with depositing my cheques"" he replies ""its a really old branch"" we exchange pleasantries I go on my way. 

I head off to my second job in Waterloo stopping to get gas and when I get to work I go downstairs to the restaurant to order a pretty big meal before work only for my card to be decline. I check my bank online to fine they’re holding my cheque, I pay in cash.

This morning I call their branch to find out the problem the girl on the phone who was very patient and polite tells me possibly scenario on why my cheque was held, none of which would affect me so she gets my information and says she'll have her manager look at it. Now mind you I wouldn’t be so upset as to write a review, if one the teller told me in plain english ""hey I have to hold your cheque to determine its real"" I would have pulled out the pay stub I had ripped the cheque from moments earlier or I wouldn’t have bought food and gas before work and at least have some money for groceries today. Secondly its happened before and only at this branch, thirdly I had signed a form from a TD branch that explained this would prevent any holds on pay cheque from my employer on record finally the cheque is a regularly deposited bi-weekly from the same account and isn't held at other TD location

As a university student it’s just frustrating, the little cash I have for bills is always needed. Anyways I apologize for the long story but if there is anyone else out there in my boat because of this branch I suggest avoiding it and making a formal complaint through the phone number on the back of your debit card, maybe then someone else won’t have to go through this. Have a good day & Happy Pride."

5,"One of my favorite TD Bank branches. The manager is amazingly kind, knowledgable and helpful. The good thing about this branch is that it's open longer than banks usually are. Convenient, located just across the street of Sherbourne subway station"
5,"Situated in a historic building conveniently across from Sherbourne station, this branch is open late and most of the staff are friendly and very professional."
1,Very unprofessional

1,Worst ever experience in a bank. The bank manager was rude and unhelpful. He would not release a reasonable amount of funds on a regularly deposited cheque. This cheque had never been held before and he was rude and unprofessional. I felt like I had a ski mask on. I took the cheque to the next closest branch and they released the full amount immediately on the spot. Skip this bank and avoid that jerk by all means.
4,Friendly staff
4,"This place looks old school, but the service is good"
5,"I like to request you to allow for online banking service i.e. easy web as I have only Access Card (VISA Debit). There is no option for registration for Debit Card holder. Pls suggest me, How do i start online banking with TD."

1,Horrible. A teller did not deposit my cheque correctly and input $30 instead of $301 leaving me with no funds in my account and now needing to file an investigation that will take up to 3 weeks to complete. Now no one is answering the phone at the branch after I've called 3 times. Horrible. Always remember to get a receipt!
