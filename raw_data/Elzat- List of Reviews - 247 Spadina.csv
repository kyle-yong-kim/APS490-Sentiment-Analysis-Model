1,Did not even bother to advertise their hours for New Year’s Eve. Closed at 4 pm
5,"I booked an appointment with Maggie Guan today. As someone who went in with very minimal knowledge with banking, she was incredibly helpful and explained every term in detail. She has such a positive attitude and I really appreciated my visit to the bank because of her. Customer service is 100%, she made conversation so that I'd feel comfortable, gifted me the TD calendar, and told me who else to contact if she was unavailable."
3,There are so many people. . .
2,"This branch in particular is not student friendly. Once I moved downtown for school, I noticed a largely negative prejudice against students in all of the banks close to Spadina and Dundas. Unfortunately this is one of them. If you're a student trying to bank here or nearby- I wish you the best."
1,"Inexperienced staff, special Financial Advisor & TD customers service"
1,"As a business account holder, the service at this location is very inconsistent. Some days everything goes smoothly, while other days you come across new employees perhaps, who don't exactly know what they're doing so they only make your life a lot more exhausting."
2,Very limited service

1,"Here are 3 reasons TD is the worst bank for small businesses, based on my experience! 1- when I contacted TD to open a 3rd business account, I found out that they do not have my business information filed correctly, and items submitted are now missing from my file. These include vital business docs like my articles of incorporation. 2- I would expected that after escalating my issue to head office, and also provided missing documents, I've no more problems & get the account opened. But no,  it took more than 2 weeks and my issue remains unresolved, and I haven't received an update in 5 days.Which makes me wonder, do they even care? 3- Throughout more than 7 interaction with TD employees I have found that they have not taken any responsibility for the error in losing my corporate documents, no one has even acknowledged the error. Yes, we all make mistakes, but I will not continue to work with a business that can't take ownership of their mistakes"
1,Worst Manager you can possibly come across. Wasted our time because he did not want to deposit our cheque. Walk down the street to the other branch they're way more helpful and competent. No issues there.

1,Your google page above says it's open on Sundays and when we arrived there Is a sign that says bank at the st clair location. Please update Google page to reflect correct hours and I'll delete review.
5,"Compared to the other TD branch across the street, this one is ten times better. Explained holding period properly, provided preper receipt and proof, and cared about its customers."
1,These guys are crooks. I closed out an account and they won't return a $150 credit that is owed to our business. NEVER USE TD BANK FOR BUSINESS IT IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE.

5,"Steven was SUCH a joy to work with. He walked us through every step of the process and made sure we understood what he was talking about. On top of that, he was super friendly and approachable."
1,Extremely long line
4,"Open late, which is great for me since I work late. There was a long line when I arrived at 7, but the wait was only around 10 minutes. The staff are really friendly and very efficient!"
1,Slow. Even with an appointment.
1,Should be a zero...worst customer service EVER! Arrived 15 mins before closing and they already closed their doors and told me and 10 other customers to beat it. Worker was rude and dismissive. By the looks of the reviews below this is a horrible bank location. Don't waste your time here.

1,"If I could give TD a zero I would. I have now reached out to my contacts at head office on the issues with the team there. Specifically Rohan Sachdev the mortgage specialist, what can I say unresponsive, unprofessional, hostile with his language and acts with a sense of entitlement like he is doing myself, my wife and our family a favour. I have documented laps of communications from him and also rude language in our emails. A customer of 25+ years and already moved our primary mortgage from there and looking now to move our corporate/small business accounts and all personal accounts by 2019. What a shame, who does the hiring of these people what a disaster. RBC btw has been amazing and white glove good bye TD!"

5,One of the best customer service experience I've had at a bank was with Customer Service Manager Tommy Wu. And this was when I was requesting to close an account. So patient and nice - wish people I was giving more business to were as great as him/this experience.
5,
1,The worst td bank. Very slow. I do not recommend coming to this branch. Queen and spadina much faster service with more people working there. 5 min walk from this branch.
5,
5,All the staff are great Asian people. I feel respect for the way how they serve to clients.
5,The tellers were really good at helping us out.

1,"Very long wait, all employees are Asian and slow. I waited 30 minutes in the line and they told me that they cannot give me a password to my online banking. Had to go to another TD"
1,"rude tellers with a chip on their shoulder!! i have family that works at td and this branch as put numerous comments on my account that are not true and is making my banking at TD a living hell!! no knowledge of services or how to use their systems(s3, c3 and admin apps) I felt no sense anyone wanted to help me"
5,The staff here are very patient and helpful.

5,Very friendly and polite staff
4,Fast service. Large number of atms.
5,Becky at the Help & Advice desk was very friendly and helpful
1,"Consistently rude and dismissive with a passion for speaking over you. Spoke to a male manager at this location and never before has anyone showed such disregard for customer service. The kicker is him lying through his teeth about TD policies, changing the maximum withdrawal rate twice within a matter of seconds, thus proving he is lying about the rate. Never again will I come to this location. That was horrendous."
4,Fairly quick. Service in two languages.
5,Knowledgeable and quick
1,I like TD bank but this location is ridiculous. Transactions I make normally at other branches many times are not possible here. No reasoning.

1,"Terrible, absolutely not knowledgeable staff.I got a mail saying that I'm eligible for a credit limit increase and I came into this branch to accept the offer. A girl, who is one of the advisors at this location, said that I need to put a deposit to get an increase even though I currently have a credit card with TD without any deposits. Really?! I went to a different TD branch and it took seconds to do without any deposits. They were very surprised I was told I need to put a deposit."
1,currently in line. I have to pee with the fire of a thousand suns. bathrooms for internal use only and don't want to lose my place in line. all of the tellers seem as uneducated as their clients. no one is moving. one out of three tellers currently holding the crying baby of a customer. what is even happening.
5,I have a US account with TD. I use their ATMs with no foreign transaction fee or ATM fee.
4,"Fast service. Even with long lines, this branch does an exceptional job grinding through the lineup. Otherwise, the tellers are always friendly and the hours are excellent."

4,There is usually a wait here.
5,"This TD bank is big in size, also quite friendly, knowledgable and various fluent staff in Cantonese, Mandarin and English. They provide decent and fast service. Also, this TD bank has 4 ATM machines which is 2 more than the one at Queen and Spadina!"

4,Very helpful when I've used it previously. Usually there is a 10 min line up to see a teller but they're helpful once you see them.
1,"Manager does not honor what was promised. Very lengthy wait times And Unless you're oriental, you get terrible service."
2,Long lines and some of the employees can be very rude.
2,Rather slow service.

1,"Worst Customer Service, long waiting line. Offered me with high interest and annual fees for credit card without explaining various credit cards with no annual fees"
