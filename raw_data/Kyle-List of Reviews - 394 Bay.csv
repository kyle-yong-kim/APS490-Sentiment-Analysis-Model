5,Love td bank and the tellers are so kind
5,"Not sure why this location received so many negative comments. I may be one of the few lucky guests? I had a good, efficient and friendly service."
1,This branch has one of the rudest customer representative I’ve experienced with any bank. I’ve been waiting ages for a new TD visa that I’ve applied for and merely called the branch to check if they’ve received it. Is it really that much to ask to do a simple check? Instead I got a hostile woman acting like I have no right to even call and ask. There are many branches in the downtown area. Avoid this one if you can.

1,"If i have an option to put zero rate, i would do so. Absolutely horrible experience at this 394 bay st branch. The moment i walked in, it seemed i interrupted the conversation between the TD youge man and the inquiry desk person who told me her name is Margo, which on the tag seemed Margaret. She gave the attitude since then, wanted to kick me out from the first sec. I insisted having the appointment, which she gave me the next day 4pm. I asked for two general 800 numbers, one was for the back office, one was for the customer service, she refused me both, and told me you could find it on my card back. I've never seen anyone in my whole life who can be that rude, and negative. How bank allowed this kind of person stays, most important at the inquiry table."
1,"nice tellers. though, management in TD is a cry and shame."
1,"Worst TD I’ve ever been to. As a trans person, they were not willing to help me add notes about the pending name change or anything to help me deposit cheque’s. Transphobic comments were made and I do not recommend their service to anyone."
5,Best branch
1,"I went to this branch twice. Both were absolutely horrible. The customer service people don't even know what they are doing. On the first instance, he screwed up my account by resetting my password while I was requesting it for a different account. In the second instance, CSR Briggite was helping me. She don't have any product knowledge. She couldn't answer any one of my questions and more over she was so rude to me. This bank should employ people who loves the job, who value Canadian culture. I will never ever go to this branch, if there is any alternative."
1,Absolute terrible service. Served someone who wasnt even in line while there was like 10 people in line. Seriously makes me consider changing banks

5,Good service
5,Newly renovated TD bank! Friendly staff.
1,"on April 22nd. I went to this branch to withdrawal money. I deposited coins and as usual I asked to have the same number of empty rolls for the future time. (usually i deposit empty rolls every week (around 400 dollars each time), since my particular job). I'm a client of TD since 2009. The girl at the desk told me that she was told to tell me that they couldn't give me empty rolls, I had to buy them a dollarama. I said that this never happened in 10 years of TD, and in no one branch they gave me that answer. Then she came back with few empty rolls and she said, ""this is what I can give you"". I I pointed out that many rolls were missing, no one of 1 or 2 dollars, etc.. she said, ""we need the empty rolls for our business"". I asked to talk with a manager. the manager is named Eduardo Brandao (I asked his business card). he confirmed that they use the rolls that they have for their business. this is a joke, I'm a client of TD, I'm bringing to them money since 10 years and this is not their business..? ridiculous, very disappointed by this."
5,the staff who assisted me was super friendly and helpful. the building itself is also beautiful and really comfortable to be in
5,"I have started using the bank branch regularly as I work in the area. I have had incredible experiences with all the levels of staff I have encountered and yet to have a bad experience. Their front desk staff are great. Personable, helpful, and curious. Their investment personnel are also more of the above. I have had numerous encounters when staff have been incredibly accommodating, working right up to and even past closing when they are supposed to be shutting down, and just going out of their way to find answers to complicated problems."
5,"Great bank branch. Very casual, modern and relaxed. Has a great view of the old city hall through the glass walls. The furnishing is more like a casual artsy cafe rather than a typical bank. A giant screen gives weather predictions and news headlines, tweets etc."
5,"I had an issue with my accounts that TD could not resolve for me for years. I went to this branch & Ayush, who was the branch manager came to help me. Not only did he help me with what I came in for, but helped resolve my issue after asking for my banking experience with TD. He was very professionally dressed & was always smiling. He's a keeper. I'll be banking with TD for a very long time. Thank you"
1,"Very upset! As an online entrepreneur, I have issues dealing with lunatics on a regular basis. It's the internet! The ""bank"" decided to block my account, based on the arbitrary word of an immigrant student who wanted me to cheat on his home work ..I am more the disgusted. After 4 hours of arguing and ZERO LEGAL ACTION, the jokers unlocked my account. Long story short...any idiot can get your account blocked with zero evidence and they will not even TELL YOU!"
1,"Extremely bad service. The staff left many waiting outside with the doors locked past the opening hours (9am), and were very unprofessional and cold, not to mention the lack of professional attire and character"
1,"I would give this location zero star if I had that option. I was at this branch yesterday to do some urgent banking and asked to speak with the manager and a young male came forward. My interaction with him was the worst I have experienced at any bank. I have been a loyal TD customer for 24 years. The manager's insincerity, unwillingness to help, defensive attitude and disrespectful tone was shocking and was more than enough for me to decide to move my entire portfolio to another bank. He definitley seemed not trained enough to deal with customers and unfit for a manager. I do not normally post public ratings but my experience was beyond disappointing which compelled me to write this review. I recommend avoiding this location."
1,"Horrible experience with the clerks, long waits AND they wouldn't even cash in my cheques!"
1,"Actually, i do not like to comment negatively, but what i’ve experienced at that TD branch was sooo disappointed. I went there on thursday to open a bank account, i met one lady whom was in charge that day but (she seemed careless) yes, i didn’t have an ID, she told me if i want i can comeback saturday with ID, i asked her if i do need an appointement, she said no you don’t. Supresingly, i goback there today they told me that if i don’t have appointement they can not help me, (obiviously that lady she wasn’t there). Terrible service ever had, no customer care. Totaly they do not care about customers."
1,"I did a wire transfer and the bank teller didn’t know where my checking or routing number is on my American check. In addition, he had no idea what my Swift code was and said this might work... I said no I’ll call my bank in the USA and find it for SURE. He said umm ok cause if I get it wrong your wire would take two weeks. It’s been two days no money - The wire is suppose to be delivered in 24 hours- SMH!!!!!!!!"

1,"The one asian guy at the front is as rude as it gets.. he didn't give me a form because ""there are alot of other customers in line""."

3,Branch looks really nice but staff also needs to be kind to TD customers.
1,"Everytime I come here, it is boiling. Youd think a major bank would have the money to blast AC to go along with there massive lines"
3,There is always long lines at this location. It’s a big space with a lot of room to sit but seems a little unnecessary. Do patrons actually sit to hang out at a bank? I’ve never seen it. There is access to the PATH of you go down the stairs.

1,Worst location ever!

2,"This branch is really really ridiculously slow. About one customer served by teller per 10 minutes. Have been here for 30 minutes, four active tellers"

5,"Sheresse, Manager Customer Service and team = A W E S O M E. TD CT's BEST Branch in downtown Toronto to Calgary, AB.."
5,Excellent banking service
1,
1,Nice people but Beyond slow where there's a 15 meter line yet they don't bother calling the other employees to jump on when they were clearly free from downstairs.
1,
1,1. Long wait time. 2. The Teller with a nose ring and the managers (Alyssa and Sheresse) were completely useless and they acted like they hated their jobs . Sheresse told me to hurry up with my transaction as she felt I was taking to long. She said that there are other people in line. She wouldn't allow me to close my bank account either. I will be moving to RBC or BMO in the Cert near future .
5,Excellent branch.
1,"EXTREMELY BLONDE HAIRED AND BRIGHT BLUE EYES TELLER LADY LIED STRAIGHT TO MY FACE WITH A SMILE..... went skating across the street at nathan phillips square, needed cash to pay & went to TD ... i tried to use the atm & took to long and it took my RBC debit card, when i informed the teller she seemed ready to assist me until she went to 3 staff members sitting at 1 desk drinking coffee at 9:45am who told her to tell me... they dont do that here i must go to my own branch and apply for a new card THIS WAS A STRAIGHT FACE LIE. (the friend i was with works at a TD!!!!) terrible to none customer service offered here Dec 7, 2017. not 1 person was in the line up behind and they refused to assist me"
5,Great customer service!

1,"Very cool looking td. It was little bit busy at lunch time, but pretty empty by 4 pm"
5,I don't leave reviews often but today afternoon I was taken care of by Renjie Lie at an exceptional level. He truly put customer service to a new meaning and went above and beyond in order to assist me to my best needs. Best of all the atmosphere in this banks branch alone is worth visiting and unlike any other TD Bank I've ever been inside of. Very futuristic vibe and design. Good work TD!
1,"This is the worst TD brunch in Toronto, they are rude horrible customer service, they yell at you, and they give you service as they want depend on their mood, THE MANAGER KASSANDRA MAUTI along with the teller EMMA refuse service and even when i was leaving i turn around and they were laughing at my back, stay away from this brunch with the most vicious service that anyone can offer! the reno doesn't do it"
1,No customer service. The manager Kassandra is rude. Stay away from this location.

4,Nice place. Friendly staff. Cozy and convenient. The only downside so far is a long line from time to time.
1,I always try to avoid the customer service people at this bank. Very rarely a good experience.
1,"So. Slow. Waited over 30 minutes to see a teller. 6 desk, only 2 were working."
5,"This is the best TD Trust downtown branch newly renovated and reopened this year. Glass like a green house full of light from all glass facade. An animated screen so huge across its wall near ceiling projecting people images, welcoming customers to enjoy banking. Cushioned seats at the front street level and down near The Path subway maze. Make yourself free coffee as a customer downstairs. The grass is greener on this side..."
2,"My experience in opening the investment account was disgusting. They lost my application and claimed their fax machine technical issue had been the cause!!, i was expecting more welcoming and customer care."
1,"I've come to this location multiple times because it is down the street from where I live and super convenient! That being said, this location has the worst wait time I've ever seen and with only 1-2 tellers during peak service times. For a new and large location, I've never experienced such bad service and timelines from entering to exiting the branch."
5,
1,No Customer service. Long waiting and why they allow to chewing gum while talking to clients??
1,"Very bad customer experience, long waiting lines. New face of TD with bad customer relations."
2,"Trying to open an account took twice as long as projected due to representative forgetting to get a signature from me and then because of a discrepancy while entering my address. Every time I line up for the teller, I am amazed at how slow such a large branch can operate. Location's great, though."

5,Kassandra - the branch manager was super helpful in resolving my problem with the Credit Card. Exceptional Customer Service!

1,"I called in to TD recently to get my daily limit and transaction limits increased on my personal bank account so that I could buy some gold and silver. I was disappointed that TD routed me to a call center in India, which provided a degraded level of customer service due to the language and cultural barriers, as well as the distance. They said it was done and then I asked them to fix my mailing address, as the TD bank will amalgamate my mailing and physical addresses (which are in different towns), but the lady I was speaking to in India had no understanding of how to do that. I had previously requested this fix be made numerous times at my home branch, without them getting it done. I was then transferred to a Chinese bank rep out of Toronto who worked on it for awhile and claimed that he got it done, so we will see on the next letter I receive from TD. Anyways, going back to the issue with my transaction limit, when I got to the gold/silver shop a couple hours later I was only able to buy about half of what I had wanted to because of the incompetence of the bank rep in India, who didn't actually adjust my balance as she was supposed to. I then had to call back and was transferred to a manager in Canada who got it done at the touch of a key, but I still had to confront him about why they were using service reps on another continent to help Canadian customers, which obviously is being done to save them money, to the detriment on Canadian workers who should have those jobs. His response: ""I'm not prepared to have that conversation with you at this time."" TD should be ashamed of themselves for outsourcing customer service centers to places like India, which end up wasting their customers' time and giving us a bad experience."
3,"Regular TD experience, nothing special"
5,Good service.
1,"This is by far the worst branch in Toronto. Service is SO slow, the decor is horrible (ugly green plastic banner?!), the garbages are overflowing (at 9:30 AM, so I'm assuming we're never emptied at night) and there is literally garbage scattered across the floor. I'll make the trip to the Yonge & Adelaide location from now on."
5,It was really nice!! And so kind!!
1,"TD is the worst bank I've ever had the experience of dealing with. I've been a customer for 14 years and I was never treated as such. There were no relationships built despite trying to visit the same bank frequently. I was just someone that got pushed around because I'm in my twenties. Even in the main branch of Toronto, when I threatened to switch banks, the manager unflinchingly told me to, ""Go ahead."" -Hitesh Anand. Top notch customer service. As a business owner that takes on multiple single-job contracts from different clients, I receive my income in varying amounts from several sources. When I opened up a business account, I expected there to be a difference in the way holds were placed on deposits from personal accounts. Not here! The ONLY WAY for funds to not be held for 5 business days is to either get a wire transfer, or have it be a regular payment - as if it were a bi-weekly paycheque. Ignoring the first option because it's an inconvenience for clients, for the former - what free agent receives regular income from a source? That would be working for someone, not owning your own business. I have recieved multiple payments in the same amount from the same client a few times, but in no case was my money cleared right away because it wasn't ""regular enough."" It gets worse. After months of constantly being inconvenienced by this, I asked my client to write me a bank draft. I took it to my regular bank, and they held it because they said it might be fake. I asked if there was anything they could do and after an hour of hearing nothing, he said he'd fax the branch that issued the draft. When I came in the next day to check on the progress, the manager was not in, and didn't return my calls for 2 days. I kept calling every day until he finally let it clear ONE DAY EARLY. I should have switched banks at this point, but I figured I'd try to get the next portion of that payment as another bank draft - and maybe if I went to the same manager he would remember the last time and let it go. Was this the case? Of course not. I ask what I can do: call my client, call his bank rep, get a receipt of the draft? I was told if I did all three they *might* do it. I really needed the money, as did my employee, so I spent $100 in cabs getting all this stuff to get it in before the bank closed. After all of that, I still had to spend an hour arguing over it and it was all for nothing. Again, treated like a nobody while you take my money. I've even brought checks written out by Scotiabank themselves, and because they're never the same amount they never clear. I went to RBC today... and within 10 minutes I had an account, a representative that will personally look after my account and anything I need, and more importantly I deposited a cheque THE SAME DAY I MADE AN ACCOUNT AND IT CLEARED. TD Bank is terrible and I will never recommend anyone do business with you, nor will any of my other businesses and partners ever open an account with you. This post is just the beginning of my complaint."
