1,One of their ATM machines (outside) glitched out on me and ate my card. Had to wait over 45 mins to speak with a rep to cancel my access card. Be careful using their atm machines.
5,"Always helpful, and solution based with any issues i ever have. I was going away last minute and was able to get American Money in the amount and denominations needed. CIBC wasn’t so accommodating for me.. 1 STAR for CIBC."
2,"I was not able to deposit a money order to my biz partner’s account. The teller Alex was very kind and helpful. However, the branch manager Daniel, although seems helpful and kind at the beginning, suddenly rejected to offer his service, which he could technically and legally do so. Yes, they definitely could help. How do I know? Because I was able to deposit in a different TD branch just a couple of minutes ago. Let’s acknowledge, Daniel was not rude or ignorant. He just did not care much about the importance of customer satisfaction. Waste of an hour back and forth of a business client only makes them consider to downgrade their relationship with the bank."
1,"Terrible service! Absolutely dissapointed , you can't have access to your own money because of their own mistakes in protocol!This joke of a branch should not even exist, as the staff is completely incompetent! Will never come back, what a disaster!"
1,"0 star! It is the most terrible service I met. Employee, who is white woman with glasses, does not know how to respect customer! I have questions that why I came to the branch, actually, she is impatient with me. Just fewer customers over there at that time. I don’t know why she’s really really really want to end the conversation. When I finish the conversation, her attitude and word let me feel uncomfortable. That’s why I think she doesn’t know how to respect customer or she doesn’t care about it. I suffer humiliations from her and the branch. I hate the branch! Why treat customer like this? Who you are?"
5,"Had to process the payment through td quickly, the process was fast, easy, and convenient, I had a great experience, shout-out to the branch manager Sarah for making it happen so smoothly"
5,"Great staff, service, hours, and convenient location. The Sunday hours are a great benefit of this branch, which I take advantage of weekly...."
5,I love this bank. They have expedited the process of building my credit by working with me weekly for a year. Couldn't ask for a better bank. Big shout out to Daniel.
1,"This branch is all over the place. If you call pretty much at any time of day you will not get an answer. If you leave a message (as I have 4 times) you will never hear back. My partner has also had frustrating experiences as he has been rescheduled to get a credit card three times- one time where he sat in the waiting area for 30 minutes and then they “ran out of time” and another where he showed up and “no appointments were on the schedule” yet the teller remembered booking his appointment. Constantly frustrated, wishing it wasn’t the closest branch so I wasn’t forced to go there."
5,Raul and Luis went above and beyond to get a complex wire transfer done. I really appreciate their attention and hard work on a time-sensitive matter of great importance.
1,"If I could only give zero star. Never been treated this way anywhere. I had to wait in the line for 20 minutes, just so I could ask somebody to why no body is approaching me for my appointment! After that, the staff member told me to ""sit down!"" without apologizing for wasting my time! And after 40 minutes, still nobody helped me and nobody apologized to me! I had to just leave! Such horrible service for a booked appointment!"
1,"Definitely not going to this branch again, manager did not help me at ll with the problems I had with the account, besides one of the tellers in the location of Bloor and sherbone gave me the wrong account number and now I lost so much money because of that error and the money that was supposed to be in US dollars is all now in CAD dollars. PLEASE, be more professional, none of this would have happened if it was not for your mistakes."
5,Staff is so friendly and open. They helped me with exactly what I needed and fast too.
1,The service is very good. But the security (old lady) is very rude she made me so embarrassed in front of other clients because I was talking to my friend in other language.

1,Worst hours. For a bank downtown this is kind of a joke.....
4,"Both TD and Canada Trust were my preferred banking institutions. I was worried when they combined because I expected to lose the benefits of both. Instead, I gained. Right now, I'm with an online bank because I'm virtually broke, but I hope to return to TDCT eventually. They're friendly, and they actually seem to have bothered getting to know me and my needs rather than just the banker's handbook."
5,"Great service, great location, great hours."

5,"Great customer service every time! I go out of my way to come to this branch, the staff really do go out of their way to make your visit pleasant! Banking isn't always the easiest or stress-free, but the folks here make it easy and stress free!"

1,Slow staff....ridiculous line ups. Chop chop you're working downtown Toronto...
4,Great customer service.
5,Easily the best customer service at any bank in the city. The staff will go above and beyond to give you good advice. One of the staff saved me $$$ on a checking accounting. How awesome is that?
