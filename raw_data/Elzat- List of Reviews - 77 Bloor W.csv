1,"I left this bank feeling disrespected. The service is awful. The tellers are unknowledgeable and unprofessional. I spoke to the manager, and she turned her back on me. Looking at the reviews, it seems like it's the standard."
1,Horrible experience. Stuff didn’t know what he was doing and never returned calls. Different people provided contradictory information. Wasted a whole month there. Will never visit again.
2,"Always insanely long lines with many empty counters, never had a short wait here. Quite poor service for what’s supposed to be one of the main branches in the city. Most reps are very nice but I also had a very unfriendly, combative one just yesterday."
5,"Went here yesterday taking a shot in the dark to see if they could help me with an issue with my US TD Bank account, turns out TD Canada Trust and TD Bank in the US are only tangentially related (different banking laws and systems,and whatnot but same parent corporation), so they didn’t have any access to my account in the US. However, Sajid and Robert at the front desk bent over backwards to help me unlock my account by calling them and using the two banks relationship to clear up the issue on the account and give me back access to my money. This was easily the best customer service experience I’ve ever had in a bank. I almost never leave reviews of anything, but Robert in particular was so incredibly helpful, I felt that his efforts and kindness deserve recognition. Thank you so much!"
1,The slowest employees ever. Standing there for 20 mins and the line hasn't moved. They're just helping the same 4 customers over like they have all the time in the world
5,"Love TD Canada Trust bay Bloor Branch. They have gone out of their way to provide great service and that 'Z' factor. Thank you,"
1,I’ve been waiting at the customer service desk for 15 minutes and an advisor asked I think a teller to come help me. She had red hair - came over and was mumbling about how she didn’t want to do it. Very professional. Super appropriate. So mature.
1,Getting real tired of TD. Horrible customer service
1,Too much AC here both my friend and I caught a cold from waiting 25 min in line

2,Bad customer service
1,"I had a horrible experience at this branch today. I met with Brandon Lee, a financial advisor, to switch my investment product. Due to the fees being lower on the product I was looking to switch to, Brandon tried to convince me to choose another option. After listening to him speak, I let him know why I was looking to make the change and justified my reasoning for being adamant on the product with lower fees. When he realized my mind was made, he became hostile. He said he could not help me and I would have to figure it out on my own. I was shocked! He refused to provide me with any resources, emails, or phone numbers to call which lead me to end the meeting. As I walked out, I stopped an employee and expressed my frustration at the rudeness and lack of assistance Brandon provided. The employee (whose name I did not get) quickly explained the steps I needed to take make the change and asked me who I had met with. When I said Brandon, the employee immediately rolled his eyes (seems I'm not the only one Brandon has upset). Whether he realizes it or not, Brandon is representing the entirety of TD when interacting with clients, and today he did not represent well. I am currently meeting with the other large Canadian banks to find one with better service."
1,Slow service. There are 4 out of 10 clerks working with a huge line up.
5,"I want to give a shout out to Sajid Ahmed (Assistant Branch Manager) and Grazia (Financial advisor). I had to switch my mortgage to an open term mortgage under a very tight deadline, and Sajid made sure that it was done within the deadline. He literally submitted by application and at midnight on same day and sent me a confirmation email. He was dealing with a family situation at that time but he made sure that Grazia or someone else was there on the branch to help me whenever he was not available. Grazia was also very helpful and responded to my queries very timely and reached out to me promptly for each step. This guy deserves an employee of the year for providing best customer service to the customers."
1,"Worse service ever! They don’t want to help, nor explain... but they sure want to push you stuff! Stay away!"
1,"Pathetic customer service. Was made to wait 30 mins past my scheduled appointment time. When asked him much more time will it take, receptionist informs she has no idea. People who don’t value their customers time don’t deserve any business at all."
5,Friendly staff. Very helpful. I like the renovation. I prefer to go to bay bloor TD for my every day banking.
5,"Had a overall good experience at this branch. Went in to open a new account, called in advance to book an appointment. Although they made, wait as it was quite busy. Mr Abid who assisted me was polite, extremely helpful and very professional."
1,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO USE THIS BRANCH!!! 20 years TD customer, this has been the worst branch I had to deal with in three different provinces. Had two interactions with them in the past month one rep created the wrong account that froze my funds in the air for 2 weeks. second needed an action to be taken on a different account, a different rep did not return my calls for a week in spite of leaving messages and once she did was on a weekend with absolutely no clear answer she still had no clue whatsoever."

1,It was a day after Mothers day. My mom is a new immigrant. She called TD about one of their products but they were rude and hang up on her while she was talking slowly. I am so frustrated to hear this and TD that I have been using can they become so discourging and unfriendly to customers.
1,This is the worst experience ever. The set up of the bank is very out dated. It literally took me over one hour to get a wire done. I’ve been banking with TD for many year. It’s very disappointing. Will never visit this branch.
5,"I went at lunch time and it was terribly busy. Despite this, they had many tellers on duty who were very obiously efficient and hard-working. The lady who helped me was very friendly and helpful. All of this during major renovations at the branch. Hands down, an amazing experience."
1,"Terrible branch, slow sevice and no polite. Many workers and the service is really bad. I made a simple international transfer ans it took 1h and at the end the account number was wrong. I lost all my time. Td is decreasing its service"

1,"This location is utterly pathetic. Your located downtown. Blocks away from church street. You would think you wouldnt hire a transphobic greeter/information consultant. This asian man who worked at the front had the nerve to refer to me as ""he"". When i corrected him he apologized yet was snickering behind my back. He purposefully misgendered me. Please teach your employees about transgender women. Its 2018 theres no excuse for bigotry. I will personally stop by there later on today to speak with his manager."
4,Nice and helpful. Sometimes they need more staff.
5,"Jenny at front desk was extremely helpful and countable, appreciate the help! Would consider move my home branch here!"
1,Staff seems to do the bare minimum to help. Not a good branch to go to if you need financial advice in my opinion.

1,"Worst customer service .. had to wait 20
Mins for the service and the representative was slightly rude"
5,"They have an experience, so help me all the time. For faster serving time - consider morning hours"
1,I was in earlier today and my god the customer service was shocking. I wanted to enquire about applying for a credit card and was left waiting over an hour while customers who came after me were seen to as I was left there unhelped or questioned. I had to return to the counter to remind them once more that I was there by which stage I couldn't wait any longer. I found them very unapologetic and aloof to the issue. It has made me want to just close my account and switch to a different bank where they care about their customers more. I won't be returning.
4,"I’ve been coming to this branch for as long as I can remember. The staff the help desk are 75% of the time very fast and very professional, the 25% of the time are slow, rude/negative and do not want to help you. This often creates this uncomfortable feeling of going and talking to them. The tellers are always great - fast, professional and friendly. Just how you’d think of perfect tellers. My small business advisor was amazing - very helpful, knowledgeable and offered the best for our needs."
1,Service takes a long time
4,"I have never had any problems at the location. Amazing staff members have always helped me out. Large location, love the new renovated look."
3,very slow and no the best service
1,An elderly lady was the worst worker ever. she couldn't solve the problem besides she didn't even try to ask any other coworker. Don't go there.
4,Friendly staff. Usually quite busy.

5,"Deposited 3 cheques that were suppose to contain separate transactions in my account, but they were consolidated into one which was not what I wanted; returned to the bank a few hours later and they were able to sort everything out. Good on them for resolving this"
4,"Very convenient location, great customer service"
1,"This branch has one of the worst levels of customer service I have experienced in my life. I had a scheduled appointment with an adviser, and he was with some one else for more than 20 minutes."

1,Worst beach down town. Business line has ONE person working on it. Faster to go in the consumer line 3 times before they even help you in the business one. Will not use this branch again.
1,"Treated so rudely. Went to deposit a cheque that i never have an issue with from a very known company and after the teller walked away to get a ""initial from the manager"" which I found odd , I watched him and the manager chit chatting for 5 minutes before I had to go and ask if there was a problem. The manager then came over and asked to see my personal emails to confirm I worked those days for the employer I was depositing from !!! . I have deposited at the teller at other locations from the employer before which she was too lazy to back track them all which is the reason for the emails. No apology. No explanations. Just as if I was some scum . Wow."
2,"So slow, always busy."
1,This place has one of the worst levels of customer service I have experienced. The manager defended his employee - a gloried bank teller - despite the fact that he was giving us attitude. They should both be fired for disrespecting customers.
1,Absolutey hostile staff. The business account manager will get into a shouting match with you over the tiniest details. Total idiot branch manager will only defend the employee even if the employee was totally rude to you
5,This is the only (TD) bank that closes at 8pm all the (TD&Other) banks close​ at 6pm
5,Very friendly and welcoming place. Courteous service by understanding staff.

5,"Friendly and good service. My transaction was fast. Especially, it always opens."

5,"Just wanted to send you something to show my appreciation for your patience and your diligence the day that i met with Michael Little to set up my account with the Cross Border Banking Service. I showed up late to our appointment due to the exceptional level of inconsistency that is TTC yet he honored the commitment nonetheless. After being on the phone with a representative from Maine for over 30 minutes and getting absolutely no where, i half expected a shrug and an almost 'well, i've done all i can' attitude from Michael but he stepped up to the plate in a way unmatched by that of any other bank rep i've ever met before by calling the Cross Border hotline and demanding clarity. He also helped me set up an appointment for my Aunt and Cousin later that day with one of your spanish speaking colleagues (Mikael, if i'm not mistaken) to which they saw all their questions met with a level of exceptional competency and efficiency. It is because of the service i received that day from Michael that I haven't fallen behind or been late on any of my payments back home in the states. Car, Loans, Phone, Insurance, etc. all is up to date because of the extra 20-30 minutes he took to ensure my account had secured the necessary credentials for accessing the Cross Border Service offered by your Bank and i for one am a firm believer in giving kudos where kudos are due. Many blessings and may this next calendar year be as fruitful a year as ever"

3,"Really nice service. HOWEVER, this place is extremely understaffed. Waited over 20 mins to open my safe, and it was after rush hour 7pm."
1,"Called the bank. Specifically asking for a certain type of EUR bill to buy. Person confirmed. Went to the bank. Waited in line for 25 minutes because only 2 tellers were working. DOWNTOWN MAIN TORONTO BRANCH AT LUNCH! You have 2 tellers working? Really!? Finally got to a teller. I specifically said ""Do NOT go through with the transaction if you do not have the EUR in this certain type of bill denomination"". They said, not it's ok. We have it. Guess if they gave me whatever they wanted.."
1,Extremely slow service and rude tellers.

5,Great and fast service
1,"Terrible. Was paying some bills there once and the teller told me I had OVER PAID a credit card account that I never activated. She showed be my chequibg account where supposedly I had taken almost $2k out of my checking and put it onto a credit card that was never activated. I have NEVER over paid. And said how can someone even do that if I never activated the card? I was livid went home went over all my finances and called TD customer service. After about 30 min with the customer service rep she said you need to go to the bank in person, with id, demand an investigation BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO WORKED FOR TD BANK MOVED UR FUNDS. It has nothing to do with the credit card company. I went there told the Teller, a manager was called in who looked at the computer, he put that $ back into my account right away and appologized and said they will look into it. To this day I don't know who in TD moved that $. Lesson learned always go over ur spending and know that sone1 may be spending it for you. I do believe that 2k would eventually be taken if I didn't check it. I believe that credit card was used because I didn't activate it at all for over 3 years. Who ever took it thought it would remain unchecked. Who ever moved the $ could have worked from any TD location, as theft can be done electronically. It should be noted that I have only used this location for the last 5 years"
5,"Super nice people working there. Even though there is a line, it's never super long wait times. Always have had pleasant customer service."
5,"Excellent customer service. I came here in a bind, and was greeted with professional, helpful and quick customer service. You know the times you go to the ""Help & Advice"" counter at a bank, only to be told that you need to go stand in line - not here! The lady who attended me was awesome! I explained my situation to the lady at the counter (wish I had noted your name), who was quick to lay out my options and escalate the issue to her manager to see if she could help me out. She really went out of her way, and I was quite impressed by how quickly they were able to help me out. One of those times that made me happy that I bank with TD :)"
5,People here are nice and patient. love here
