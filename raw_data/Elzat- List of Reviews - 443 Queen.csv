1,"Do not ever go to this branch as they are absolutely the worst.  They have an incompetent team which doesn't understand the needs of the customers.  They put a hold on a youngster's student loan cheque for a week when his rent was due.  The cheque was issued by OCAD, one of the oldest colleges in Toronto. They do not evaluate the individual needs of their client.
The manager in a different TD branch was much more willing to see the situation and deal with it.  I spoke to a woman, Cassandra, who claims to be the manager of this branch, who needs to be taught how to deal with clients.
We will be closing our account with Td bank in Canada and in the USA.  We don't need to be treated badly when we need to access our money."
5,Friendly staffs and great service
1,"The customer service needs improvement. I never had such prejudiced opinionated staff. She literally asked if I'm able to call VISA customer service myself. TD, you need to monitor your staff."
1,"Very weak branch, provide poor experience and no knowledge on most of products and things. If you have any issues do not trust that ranch"
1,"First mistake they made was informing wrong hold time for my US cheque (instead of 21 days they said 7), and that caused huge losses from my end. Second mistake they made was unsuccessful PAD for my credit card(I gave them a void cheque and they said they didn't need it, turned out they did). Third mistake they made was I tried to made up the second mistake, and they failed again. Now after 1 month, I still don't have my PAD set up. For reference, most of the bank can do it by emailing/going online. They requires me going into the branch, and their mistakes waste my time and energy to run to the branch several time. Simply incompetent and disguising. I'm moving. Period."

1,"Don’t bother trying to deposit or cash cheques here, they enjoy placing holds on them for no reason and lie when you question them."
1,"If I could give TD a zero I would. I have now reached out to my contacts at head office on the issues with the team there. Specifically Rohan Sachdev the mortgage specialist, what can I say unresponsive, unprofessional, hostile with his language and acts with a sense of entitlement like he is doing myself, my wife and our family a favour. I have documented laps of communications from him and also rude language in our emails. A customer of 25+ years and already moved our primary mortgage from there and looking now to move our corporate/small business accounts and all personal accounts by 2019. What a shame, who does the hiring of these people what a disaster. RBC btw has been amazing and white glove good bye TD!"

1,"The service was horrible and the teller was not willing to compromise. 
She did complete the task but has too much attitude"
1,"Worst bank ever. They messed up my spousal RRSP account setup, so all this time, my wife (no income) has been contributing to my RRSP instead of the other way around! Now 7 months later, it is still not corrected and they will not reply to me."
1,rude staff
1,"Manager was unwilling to give a discount on a large currency conversion, wanted to charge me 3% unless I was doing $250,000 LOL"
1,"Worst branch, the staff are rude and incompetent don’t know how to deal with customer and the worst part they try to make you the customer look bad. Never going there again."
1,"Suddenly started putting all my cheques on hold. The manager Victoria was too ""busy"" to clear my cheques. Staff and manager was not able to explain why the sudden change. Wasted my staff's time and my time on the phone talking to her. Absolutely terrible experience. I would not recommend this branch."
2,"Came over at 8:00 to exchange US dollars, the doors were locked at 8:10! Freezing outside and I have a flight to catch! Poor customer care!"
5,"This is location is very helpful. Now onwards, I will prefer to do business at this branch. Joseph was very friendly and knowledgeable."

1,I just dont like dealing with TD. I deal with another bank as well and this bank seems to act disrespectful when you try to do banking at their bank in a different city than your home city. I never get treated this way with my other bank. And consistently TD is an uncomfortable experience.
1,"I was there last week to change some cash USD to CAD and because of a mistake of the cashier I lost $100 USD and I don't have any way to recover my money now. A bank must be a place to trust, really disappointed."
1,Everytime I come to this branch I wait a minimum of 20 minutes to see a teller. They obviously know this is a busy location why don't they hire more workers here.
5,"I love the people that work there, but not the company."

1,"My second time at this branch to deposit some checks and both times experienced very bad service. This last time the girl apologized over and over again for putting the deposit on hold to clear because it was a large amount. It was at the end of a long day and I was tired and just wanted to get out of there, she tried to make small talk but I was in no mood. At the end of the transaction she made a snide comment saying ""don't get too excited"". And now I find that she put a hold on ALL my accounts and I can't even take out $200. I am calling the branch today to complain and get her fired! She has no business working in a customer service function!!"

1,This branch is terrible. Wait times are ridiculous. They'll have 20 people in line for the plebeian banking services waiting for half an hour but will serve the business people as soon as they walk in (which is seldomly) and have double the staff waiting for them.
3,You figure the queen street location in the heart of china town would have chinese currency but they don't.

1,Pretty much bunch of racist people here
1,"This is a commentary on an article I saw in the Toronto Star on Nov. 29th concerning the racial abuse suffered by an Asian Canadian woman at this branch. This branch displayed poor judgement and did not offer their client a safe environment. Verbal abuse threatens the security of individuals and the bank in many ways just as physical threats do. Until this branch's managerial sector offers a clear protocol to deal with this type of threat, I will continue to publish and spread their inability to deal with common day racial prejudice and public conflicts."
3,Convenient buy always busy
5,Comfortable waiting area in this branch

2,Very slow moving service. Expect long line and even longer than expected wait times (given the lineup).  Service at Dundas and Spadina location is significantly faster.
5,"This location is excellent. Ally at the help desk is the best person ever. Helpful, knowledgeable, and fast. Most of the tellers are great."

1,"Worst Bank Service ever, can't even close my account so I can go back to Meridian... Terrible service"
5,Today I am very happy and glad that I bank with TD. The employee that I banked with tiday was not just there to do his job but he seemed genuinely there to be helpful and brighten my day.
