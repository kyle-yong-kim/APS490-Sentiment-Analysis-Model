5,I really enjoy coming here to stare at Patrick and his cute bow ties. He's so handsome.
5,"Courteous and friendly staff. Always dealt with our business needs in a prompt and professional manner. Huge upgrade from a former TD location in the Distillery District which was comparably unfriendly and brusque, and made me feel they didn't want our business. Worth the bike ride up to Parliament and Carlton without a doubt."
4,Ive Been useing this TD Branch when it started on Queen street. The only thing i didnt like was how fast the staff changed. But i think its a training bank. U meet some very nice people who r there to help and they all do there job well. The manager he is a great helpfull person. My dog loves to go there for the treats. Thank u team for a job well done and always a pleasure to come in to talk to staff.
1,"One of the worst td bank I ever had. Worst staff, keep talking and not working"
5,Helpful and polite staff
3,April 1st - The staff here were condescending and incredibly rude to me after all my ID and cards were stolen. I went I. To get some advice about what I needed to do to protect myself and initially they treated me with suspicion instead of just giving me the advice I needed to protect myself. I am a person of color and I had to wonder if the bad service and poor treatment instead of compassion for someone who had just gone through some thing traumatic was due to this. The advice I received over the phone was much better. Avoid this branch if you can. April 15 - I went into the branch to have a meeting with the manager Danny. He is new to the branch and was extremely helpful with advice and fixing the errors that his employees had made with my accounts. I hope he is successful in bringing up the branch’s standards. Avoid dealing with Patrick. He is rude suspicious and at best unfriendly. He does not seem to understand that his job includes customer service. I can’t imagine the other employees can be comfortable working I. The environment he creates.
1,It so happens I was in the bank today I was standing in line (a long line)Friday April 12th 2109 and notice a guy talking to the teller and then noticed that a Chinese gentleman got up so abruptly from behind his desk(manager) maybe.. not sure? He came across like he had alot of authority and then he started raising his voice VERY VERY loudly to the the guy at the counter..I then realized it was the guy that owns the Shawarma restaurant up the street on Parliament ..the bank employee started screaming at the guy for no reason that I could see or hear i was close to the front of the line..I was shocked and alittle taken back at how aggressive he was towards him. The Shawarma guy was shocked..the look on his face...poor guy...being screamed at for no reason.. I WAS READY TO TAKE A VIDEO..HONESTLY... I have lived in the neighbourhood for many years and word spreads and I remember someone mentioning to us about this man at TD Bank (a Chinese manager) kind of warning us about his attitude ...and then I realized THIS IS THE GUY THAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT.. for being short tempered and RUDE to customers...(PATRICK)(I'm sure it was him... It was so SHOCKING how he spoke to this customer AND SO DISRESPECTFUL!! Good lord I hope I never have to deal with him..But I can tell you he would never speak to me that way... ever!!!! Disgraceful!!! Why is he(PATRICK) SO ANGRY?? He is in customer service...at the bank for crying out loud!! HES NEEDS A WARNING FROM HEAD OFFICE as this behaviour is unacceptable.. Cant wait to talk to the restaurant guy and let him know I saw and heard everything and will also mention this experience to my people in Cabbage Town...Shaking my head.

4,Th branch service level has improved a lot since its opening in the old cabbage town a few years ago. And the employee product and bank guideline knowledge has also improved. I used to dread to go into the branch to do things I can’t do online. Now I actually smile going to this branch. Well done!
3,Just OK.

5,Great.
5,The staff was helpful and polite
1,Poor experience almost eveytime. Staff will give you reasons why they can not do something rather than trying to do it. Atrocious TAT’s

3,"Some staff are very friendly and others are very unprofessional. The good employees don't last long -- they're moved to other locations. Everytime I go there, they have a different crew. Such a shame."
5,Staff always with polite and good service.

5,VERY POLITE STAFF VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT SERVICE.
1,"One of the worst TD branch I dealt with, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT n this is why; when I got approved for a loan I was told I have to let them know 2 days in advance to withdraw the money. So I called on Friday hoping to withdraw the money on Tuesday, a lady calls me on Monday saying she can only order it for Friday. I wasn't able to pick d money on Friday for personal reasons so I called on Monday hoping to pick it up ASAP only after a frustrating conversation with one of the staff I spoke to the manager I was told I can only pick up the money next Friday. It seems 2 business days only if u order it on Friday so they can have the money ready by Wednesday. Avoid this branch if you can..."
5,I dropped in to take advantage of their early morning hours. Elenie was wonderful. Very helpful and pleasant and helped me with my situation. I highly recommend this branch. Fantastic people.
4,"We're always greeted with a friendly Hi, and most of the staff know us by our first name and take the time to chat! Very friendly and attentive staff!"
5,....satisfied customer :-)
5,"Very nice people, friendly local feeling, from routine stuff at the counter to financial consultations. And quick and efficient service."
3,The staff changed and it's like everyone got dumb. I know what a TD teller can do and it's continuously disappointing to go there.
