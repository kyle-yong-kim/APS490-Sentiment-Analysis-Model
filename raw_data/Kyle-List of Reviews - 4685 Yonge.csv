1,"Scheduled an appointment with their Adviser (Sinan) two days prior. 
Only 'advising' I received that one of his colleagues called in sick, but he'll be out in a few minutes.
25 minutes later with my wife and 5 month new-born, he doesn't have the  courtesy to checkup, notifying how much longer he will be.
Take the time and inconvenience yourself slightly and head into another TD branch. Cherry on top, are the student like staff leaning around not having the decency to apologies. 
You can teach someone on how to earn a degree to get a job, but you cant teach mannerism to the staff at that branch. Bunches of horses standing around the water well looking thirsty.
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE"

5,Excellent branch. Helpful people.
5,"Today I went there because I needed a letter stating that lean against my car has been released. Although it is another department, Nancy W. helped me out. She called to Auto Finance Department and got the letter emailed to her. Now I can sell my car without problems. Thatâ€™s how the customer care should look like. She is the best. :))"
5,"This has been my ""home"" branch for the past 10 months, and I can definitely say it's the best branch uptown. Friendly staff, they remember my name, I'm recognized instantly by the staff as soon as I walk in. Transactions are fast and accurate, and tellers are always helping me save money by providing the latest trends and news. Yes, the parking space is limited, but the service here outweighs all of that by far"

5,Excellent customer service! Very pleasantly surprised
1,"Poor Customer service. Very unknowledgeable and discriminatory staff. I have all of my accounts at TD (from long ago) but I would never choose TD if this was my home branch. They have lost my replacement credit card on two occasions, could not provide me with a simple assessment for investments, and could not write emails to me unless I sent them one first (out of laziness). Terrible branch."
