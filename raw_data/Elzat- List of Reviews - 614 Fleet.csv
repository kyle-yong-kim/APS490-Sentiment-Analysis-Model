5,Great professional service. Thanks!
1,"Here are 3 reasons TD is the worst bank for small businesses, based on my experience! 1- when I contacted TD to open a 3rd business account, I found out that they do not have my business information filed correctly, and items submitted are now missing from my file. These include vital business docs like my articles of incorporation. 2- I would expected that after escalating my issue to head office, and also provided missing documents, I've no more problems & get the account opened. But no, it took more than 2 weeks and my issue remains unresolved, and I haven't received an update in 5 days.Which makes me wonder, do they even care? 3- Throughout more than 7 interaction with TD employees I have found that they have not taken any responsibility for the error in losing my corporate documents, no one has even acknowledged the error. Yes, we all make mistakes, but I will not continue to work with a business that can't take ownership of their mistakes"
4,"The only TD in the area, decent location. The tellers are friendly and the financial advisor is great in helping me plan for my future. There timings are a bit weird at times, doesn't match up to the google page. But a great bank overall"

1,"This is the only TD branch that puts a hold on our company cheque deposits. We have over a million dollars cash flow a year, yet they won't immediately cash a $2,000 cheque from a client that's been routinely paying us for the last 4 years."
