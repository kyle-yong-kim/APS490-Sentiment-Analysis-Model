1,"It's a good branch with courteous staff. But the financial advisors are terrible. They are simple not interested in helping. Spoke to someone about mortgage and he said he would work on it for me, send me an application and details and never got anything. He asked me to remind him.. Wow is it my job to remind him to email his customer? Pathetic and so unlike td reputation. Scheduled another appointment with someone else at this branch and this guy never bothered to contact. Best to go to Bmo and Scotiabank for better service with mortgage and better rates. Pointless being td's loyal customer I'm taking my business away"

1,"Went here to discuss renewing mortgage and the customer service agent told us the advisor didn’t want to talk to us! BMO gave a much cheaper mortgage rate! Update: after this complaint, TD did match BMO’s competitive rate. Due to the initial bad experience and time wasted I have kept my review up."

2,"My experience with the mortgage ""specialist"" was not the best... I'm very new to the process and was really trying to know how much I can afford and ask about what the process is with the new mortgage incentives. 

- The person I had the appointment with was 20min late

- she wasn't really fully with me (checking her email for a deal and answering phone calls) .

- She told me that the incentives were available although it was too early since they only take effect in September (only found out this today)

- Everytime I ask a question she talks to me as if I'm trying to cheat the system or something ... I'm only trying to understand what I can do for my situation.

At the end she submitted a pre-approval request that was declined (internally based on what she told me) .... Because she didn't ask me about the proper information.

So I decided to go to another bank for my mortgage.

My advice is don't get an appointment using their online tool ...work with someone that's been recommended to you and has experience"
2,"I have been misled 3 times when I called in to ask about the safety deposit boxes. They don’t relay the correct hours in order to access the boxes over the phone and in person their customer service is absolutely horrible. JB was the person who I spoke with at the branch on my last visit, he told me to wait 2 hours, and was completely unsympathetic when I told him that I had been in a few times now and misled over the phone and he continued by saying that his manager would “maybe” be able to help me out. He mentioned that his managers priority were the tellers and not the customers. Fortunately another teller was able to help me out when he saw me standing and waiting for the manager. The manager never even addressed me. Unfortunately this is the closest bank to me which has safety deposit boxes available, I will continue to keep an eye out to see if other locations have one available so I can move branches."

1,These guys are crooks. I closed out an account and they won't return a $150 credit that is owed to our business. NEVER USE TD BANK FOR BUSINESS IT IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE.
1,Horrible bosses.

5,A year ago a lady at this bank helped me replace my damaged bill for a new one. I remember she offered me great customer service by handling the situation with good sense of humor and being quite sympathetic and nice.

My atm card was not working they helped me to get through the process seamlessly truly a 20th century banking services"
1,"By my estimation, TD is the most incompetent of the major Canadian banks. Support is slow and staff seem to have even worse training than RBC. I'm trying to get a business account closed and the process is going nowhere."
1,"Got a money order without signature, went back and ask front desk, front desk asked me to line again said it wasn't their fault"
1,Awful experience. Their best advice was to call the easy line. Spent more than 45 min waiting in line and waiting on a phone.
1,Pretty bad experience multiple times. Sadly branch manager is not helpful either.

1,They wanted to put 11 days hold on my cheque even though the business routinely gets cheques and they always pass. The man at the business center was not helpful at all. They should'n't put people behind the desk that are afraid of dealing with big money. It's a bank afterall.
1,Very poor customer service experience from this specific branch.

1,"Absolutely appalled with the ridiculous exchange fee I was charged to convert currency. On a 3.5K transaction I was charged over 10%. I phoned several times for an explanation since the fee was not explained when I signed off on it and nobody could explain how it was calculated. Bottom line is I feel like I've been robbed and completely forgotten despite my frustration. I have been a long time customer but to be honest, this along with several other issues I've had recently like the inept handling of my mutual funds and rrsp transfers And their lacklustre performance I am seriously looking for a new provider. Considering all the money I've handed over to this faceless corporation over the years being treated like a human and not just a source of revenue would be refreshing. Shame on TD."

2,After nearly 30 years as a TD client they treated me very poorly. RBC proved tremendously helpful and resolved the issue.

Had a bad experience with one of the FSM's.  

My mortgage application was declined when through this FSM, while I was accepted when I applied through a different FSM at a different branch."

1,Didn't have what I needed and offered no alternative solutions to assist me. I consistently get good customer service with TD and was surprised by this negative experience.
