1,Terrible customer service ever! CSR was so unprofessional and impolite. The manager who came for his rescue was no different. In the name of prioritizing company policy they striped customer privacy. I would say ‘fire yourself’ both CSR and the Manager either of you are fit for this job. TD needs to provide at least basic training to their front line employees especially at a location like this where most of your customers are professionals. No one has so much leisure time to deal with such a untrained bankers. Awful experience!

1,Highly untrained and unprofessional staff. Don’t know answer to anything. Even the managers are not trained enough of the procedures. This is a prime location and customers are facing really bad service. Td bank needs to really work on training the staff if they need to stay in market.
1,"Worst customer service!!! I went to make cheque deposits. The teller didn't accept the deposit due $0.06 difference between amount in words and numbers. Some cheques with missing ""Inc."" on payee's name were not acceptable too. Don't go to this branch or better don't do banking with TD."

4,One of Toronto's landmarks is very eye-catching.
4,This is one of the main branches for TD Canada Trust. Great architecture and opulence. Lines move quickly. It is located inside BCE place and upstairs from Hockey Hall of Fame.

1,"This bank truly has the worst customer service I've ever seen. I've been doing business deposits for a year now and wait 20+ minutes every time I go . The woman at the business counter is usually the same one and she's horrible . She's incredibly slow , talks too much and holds up the line . Definitely worth walking an extra 15 minutes to save you from the 30-40 min wait you'll do in the branch"

1,"They don't provide you with your own information. Instead they give you an expensive 1-800 number to ring, which doesn't work. I've now got to take the afternoon off work, costing me money, just so I can get something that work have taken 5 minutes over the phone. "

1,"TD Canada Trust penalizes loyal customers! I currently have a 5 year closed mortgage with 3 years remaining with TD Canada Trust. I want to sell my home and purchase another home, 'porting' my mortgage. Upon visiting the bank to find out what we can afford we have been told we need to qualify at 4.74%, even though we have a fixed rate mortgage at 2.89% with 3 years remaining. We were told we have to qualify at the higher rate because when our term is up the rates may be higher so TD wants to insure we can still pay. But if I walk in off the street I only need to qualify at 2.89% or possibly even less - whatever product I choose. An absolute stranger with no history with TD and the bank has no concerns whatsoever that they will be able to pay one year hence. The alternative presented was that we could choose to pay off the mortgage with a penalty of $11,347. If we did that we could qualify at any of the lower rates we choose just like a stranger off the street. How does this make any sense? How is this not a complete slap in our face. We have been long term customers for decades with the TD and yet they are making us qualify at a higher rate than a complete stranger. Or pay an exorbitant penalty to get the same treatment as that stranger. How is this not discriminatory treatment, perhaps even blackmail against a loyal customer?"
