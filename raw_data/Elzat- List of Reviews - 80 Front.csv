1,"Perpetually slow service at this location. If you ever want to walk into a branch and have to watch an understaffed location putter around trying desperately trying not no make eye contact this is your place.
Management likely the cause at they're supposed to set the example. Every time I pop in they feel the need to give an excuse, ""sorry I'm training"", ""sorry we had to do an unusual transaction"", ""sorry...""... If that's the norm, you're not managed well."
5,"The service at the TD Branch is absolutely the best I have ever experienced at any bank in my life (and I have grey hair!). All of the staff know me by name and my needs are always met in a friendly, professional and real way. At other banks I sometimes think I am dealing with robots. At this TD branch I feel I am coming home to friends. A comforting, warm and credibility-raising sense and I am so grateful for this exceptionally dedicated service."
1,"Highly inexperienced staff, poor training, management runs in circles. This branch needs executive intervention. Could not execute a one-man funeral."

1,Bad customer service
1,"This is the worst TD branch for customer service I have been in. And I have been in many, many branches. This branch: "" Sorry, it can't be done."" 15 minutes later at King and Bay, "" Sure, we can do that. Is there anything else I can help you with.?"""
1,Horrible new management horrible new staff horrible customer service especially in the last year as someone mentioned below

1,"Do not open any accounts here. This my home branch, I had terrible experience."
1,"Line of 10 people, 1 teller."
1,"Slow service, I was the third in line and waited 10mins for a one minute service."
4,"Been going to this branch in past 2 years, never had a bad experience until my most few recent visits, I don't find a new manager very helpful.. wait time is longer than before. Looks like itâ€™s not been managed lien before."

1,one of the worst td branch everywhere.
2,"1:30PM on a Monday. Called 3 times, no answer. Go in, customer service desk is closed. Business line is closed. 2 tellers working to serve a lineup of 8 people. Staff is friendly and nice, but I feel they are understaffed frequently."

1,"Place is so small, and the wait is always too long. They need more tellers. After the long wait, they always try to sell you some product or other. The scandal did not change anything, they keep up with the same aggressive tactics. Not ok."
1,"Worst TD I've ever been to Some of the staff are really nice, but overall experience is bad. Only laziness & inexperience can explain the mistakes & errors I have encountered with this branch (both with my personal & businesses acounts). At one point the accidentaly transferred my real estate sale funds to my wife's account instead.. (LOL thank god my wife is decent :D haha) The only reason I still sometimes go there is because it's close to my home. Never try to do there more than just money deposit/ withdrawal (essentially td green machine would serve the same purpose)."
1,"Long lines, more tellers should be open"

1,"I visited this location today to talk to one of the financial advisor but unfortunately they are all ""busy"". I don't see anyone besides two people. I feel like I was not welcome to talk to any one of them. The teller was okay but I don't feel sincerity when he was explaining about their promotion. (like who cares) I always go here and use the ATM but this visit today was disappointing. I will never go back at this location!!! Poor customer service!"
5,Great location. I just moved to the neighborhood. Teller was very professional and attentive. She was very speedy managing the high volume of people! Will come back to this branch.
1,"It is during lunch hour on a Wednesday and they only have one teller servicing a lineup of more than 10 people. Furthermore, i wouldn't have needed to line up at this branch in person if the teller did not mistakenly apply USD Account overdraft protection to my account. Their tellers don't know what they are up selling and the service is super slow."
1,"Had enough of this crappy place and their ""customer service"" . Being a customer for 10+ year means nothing to this place. Sure, I'll take my business elsewhere. Closed all my accounts. Bye Felicia."
5,"I've never had any bad experiences at this location. All staff members are extremely friendly, professional and competent at their jobs."

1,"Business Service section has made me upset, no attention given, in fact business teller was busy in attending and supporting other tellers who were new ignoring business customers. I waited almost for 15 minutes though there was only 1 person before me in the line. I will never try to visit this branch for business transactions. Actually wanted to give 0 star for business services, but there is no option"
5,Best branch ever

1,Poor customer service. Very Poor!
1,"WORST TD BRANCH EVER! Deposited a large cheque and they said it would be available on a certain day, when that day arrived its the next day! How can a TD bank operate lying to its customers? Maybe its alls the crack heads surrounding the area that are affecting the status quality of work, that or they are just plain stupid and lazy"
1,"This branch is close to my apartment so I tried using it for convenience. Worst mistake I have ever made as it nearly cost me $1600. They do not pick up their phone, call you back or seemingly perform simply tasks related to banking. I had to spend half my day on the phone with TD Visa trying to rectify a problem they created either through incompetence or apathy. I would rather keep my money under a mattress than use this branch again."
5,its really great to have your bank near your college....especially when it opens till late on end of weekends......
