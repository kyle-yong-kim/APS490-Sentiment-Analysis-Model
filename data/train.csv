5,It has be my TD branch for the past 15 years. They are pleasant and welcoming and they have been able to help me with some tricky situations.
1,So rude castumer service
4,Staff were very welcoming and friendly. I had a great experience.
1,"Here are 3 reasons TD is the worst bank for small businesses, based on my experience! 1- when I contacted TD to open a 3rd business account, I found out that they do not have my business information filed correctly, and items submitted are now missing from my file. These include vital business docs like my articles of incorporation. 2- I would expected that after escalating my issue to head office, and also provided missing documents, I've no more problems & get the account opened. But no, it took more than 2 weeks and my issue remains unresolved, and I haven't received an update in 5 days.Which makes me wonder, do they even care? 3- Throughout more than 7 interaction with TD employees I have found that they have not taken any responsibility for the error in losing my corporate documents, no one has even acknowledged the error. Yes, we all make mistakes, but I will not continue to work with a business that can't take ownership of their mistakes"
1,"Appointment was 1pm, my partner and I arrived on time, met an advisor called Sadaqat Ahmadi and he pointed us to a room said will be there soon. We waited for 10 mints, unbelievably he was just chilling and drinking coffee with his colleagues until I want and talk to him. They all were acting unprofessional. The worst TD brach. Never want to come back here!"
1,The worst TD branch I ever been.
1,There is racism that goes on here at the bank. one star is actually zero
4,This is my local branch located in Little Italy. Staff here are nice and friendly.
5,Fine people. Don't appreciate seeing them slurred. The staff there reflects the colors of the rainbow. Like a rainbow they are always good to see.
5,No lines and open Saturday.
5,Short lines & candies! :)
5,"I've been coming to this branch for years. They know me by name, by now. Good branch."
1,"Don't trust to this branch... they are not honest in keeping your personal information secret. The Manager is racist and wasted my six months time for mortgage, and finally denied; were as the other bank ahs given me in One Week"
5,"Got a very welcoming staff;very accommodating that i and my friend felt at home after we walked from the rain. Ashkon Alipour,the personal banking associate was so nice,friendly and he adhered to all our queries...was satisfied with their service and would recommend them"
1,Very unaccommodating and the bank teller (lady with the Indian accent) was hesitant to help us. Her tone was weird and she clearly needs to quit her job because she is bored. Worst service ever!
1,Manger out right lied to went to another branch had no issues. Not sure how regulation change branch to branch
5,so friendly that you `ll forget its a bank
4,Good staff for a standard TD Bank.
5,"we came in during a rain storm, staff give us paper towels and tissues to help us dry up"
5,"Everyone in this branch must be on happy pills! Every staff member is super friendly, courteous and genuinely interested in me. Best banking experience I've had in my 40 years in Toronto."
3,Standard TD Bank.
1,"I never had to deal with such idiocy in my entire life, avoid like the plague"
5,Very good bank..nice people
1,"2 or 3 people there are gems. As for the rest, I've never been given such a hard time in a bank. And on more than one occasion. the keep changing the card rules, on a weekly basis. what really seems to be happening is that the tellers make up the rules and the managers stand by them. So they're not banking rules, they're teller rules."
1,"terrible experience, miserable customer service"
1,"The teller made judgement calls and remarks surrounding my tattoos and appearance. Spoke down to me, put my check on hold with little explanation why. Would not let me talk to a manager and refuse to attempt to even verify my check."
5,Super friendly and helpful in setting up an rsp and tfsa. Easy and pain free from scheduling to meeting and beyond.
1,Have not had any worse experience with a bank than this branch
1,"I love TD but this branch is the worst reflection of you guys :(
I've been a loyal customer for 14 years and today I had my first bad customer service experience.
I lost my debit card last night. Went to get a new one today.
After 10 mins of the bank teller wasting my time
She told me ""I put a note on your file so next time you lose your card, you will have to show a photo i.d."" 
You guys don't except health cards though, why?
She told me to get a passport or drivers license. 
I said ""how come I've never had a problem getting a new debit card before? And now ur telling me I have to spend money on a passport?""
She sucked"
1,Extremely long wait times. Waited over half an hour to speak to someone to book an appointment to speak to a mortgage specialist before hanging up. If my time is valued this way I'll be taking my business elsewhere. Go anywhere but here..
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE!! AMAZING PERSON???? This Employee (Romtin) is really the definition of a gentleman as well as professional. This is the best customer service I have ever had the pleasure to meet. He was a totally professional in every way. Best of the best. Many thanks.
4,Came in here to get a new debit card. It was pretty much fine. The teller was fun and cool.
2,"I was recently in this TD Bank to make a deposit, however, the man at the teller was extremely unpleasant. He was a short, disagreeable little man with dark hair and a hurried voice acting as if he was too busy to help me with my deposits. The end result was that I had to pay additional fees in bank drafts as this man was most unhelpful with simple requests that other bank employees have assisted me with without issue. Also, to add there was only a few people in line and 4 tellers at the counter so there was no excuse for me to be treated in this manner."
5,"Excellent and consistent service, with helpful and friendly staff!"
5,Great service! Roman was very helpful and knowledgeable. You gotta watch out for times that you go in this location though it gets pretty busy at certain times.
4,Quick access to atm but there always seem to be a short line for other banking services
1,Horrible customer service. I had scheduled an appointment and shown up early. I still had not been seen 45 minutes after the start time of my appointment. I had asked if I could speak to the customer service manager to resolve this. I was informed that there was no manager on duty. This location is in a convenient location but is in need of better service.
5,Fast service. Usually pretty helpful.
4,"If you deal with the staff: they are terrific, but don't wait to return your 'phone calls. Wish them all much success! E.V.B."
2,"Asked the teller to switch my account from all inclusive to student account (no monthly free) and provided the documents. She confirmed the account was changed, but after a month I found out the account was still all inclusive and they charged me the high maintenance fee."
4,Nice place with friendly staff. Quite busy at times and TDs fees are a bit high but otherwise very convenient.
1,"Worst branch ever , always dirty, always a long line up , the staff is really NOT helpful at all, they go out of their way to be rude and uncaring."
2,Staff was very rude and unwelcoming. The only reason I went there was the location.
1,"Second Worst TD bank after one in ChinaTown, too many people waiting on line but two staffs on counters. Credits and loans staffs were so unfriendly and were eager to make me make a high annual fees and interest rate credit cards. Try avoid it!"
5,"I don't know why people are so mad at this branch, I've never had any problems. I cant say anything about the wait times because i usually go in the morning when there's no lines but in terms of service they're pretty good and I've never had any trouble getting what i needed done. For those wanting the envelopes back for depositing cheques at the ATM, get with the times and use the TD app on your phone to deposit cheques. You can also do most of your banking online now so to those people that still come in to do simple things like making transfers between accounts, paying credit cards, or updating your little bank book, it's probably mostly your fault that others have to wait so long in line to be able to do things that actually need to be done in person."
1,"Understaffed consistently in spite of promises this would not happen when the Bloor/Bathurst location closed. Even worse, TD central arbitrarily moved safety deposit boxes, and then demanded more money for a bigger size I never asked for."
1,it continues to amaze me how badly this branch is run. The service is extremely slow because this bank is consistently understaffed teller wise and of the few tellers that are there they have extremely long conversations with people which is causing long waits and long line ups. Yes it is nice to have a convo with them but seriously when you've got long lines waiting to do business with the bank it is unwarranted to hold up the lines by taking your sweet time talking. They have now even removed deposit envelopes at the atm machines so you are forced to go in and wait in line to deposit cheques. Not all of us have 10 to 20 minutes to wait in line to do this stuff. This bank continues to cut back more and more and they make tonnes of money. Bring back the envelopes and start hiring more tellers.
1,"incredibly bad experience there. the person who helped me could barely string a sentence together, the manager ignored me even though i had been defrauded and it was serious situation. i was there for over an hour and they didn't even resolve my problem. go to a different branch."
1,"I was turned away when I needed to make an emergency wire transfer near the end of their operating hours as they ""do not handle cash transactions"". I had no cash. I called TD and they confirmed they should have been able to process my wire transfer. 1 star. Will not visit again."
1,Not a branch
2,Not a real branch - no cash transactions happen here FYI
1,"Been here before to exchange usd to cad, had no issues, super easy. Went there recently, and the teller said they magically donÅft exchange money, ever. I donÅft go to any other bank but this one. Why would there even be a bank without cash exchange. 0 stars if i could."
1,It's not a bank!
5,"Extremely friendly staff within a beautiful, cozy branch."
5,"Friendly staff, modern branch style."
5,I 've followed this branch since they were at Queen & Euclid and been a TD client since the 80's. I will usually go there to deposit bunch of cheques with the same customer service rep. They are knowledgeable and friendly. I always recommend all my tenants to go there opening their new accounts. Thanks TD Banks!
5,"Highly recommend this branch!! I've been an RBC client for many years, but have been recently disappointed due to poor communication and service. Switching to TD has shown nothing but EXCELLENT customer service (especially from Mark, Carlo & Hannah), who have been extremely helpful and professional."
5,"Not usually busy,great customer service,the workers are super fast and know what they are doing."
1,"I found this to be a really bad example of a TD branch. Based on other peoples reviews, I think I just got unlucky with who was helping me. I went in to open up an rrsp and there was clearly a severe lack of knowledge surrounding the topic. I felt uncomfortable after receiving different information from 3 employees who weren't really interested in my personal banking needs, but rather placing me with a product I didn't want or need. Thankfully this was the total opposite experience from what I'm used to at my normal branch. I would avoid going here in future."
4,very convenient with great ostumer service
5,"I've been to this location twice when it first opened. It's a smaller branch with two tellers. Really good customer service here, always in and out quickly."
5,"I went into this branch some time ago for the first time and had a great positive experience with Ayaa Kamil. She is very bright , and actually cares about the people who bank there which for me has been a rare experience with TD. I continue to visit this branch and see her exclusively . 5 stars."
1,Went in to upgrade to a ulimited chequeing account shortly before the summer of 2018. I donÅft check my banking much IÅfm very busy had a new baby and have been swamped with other things. Found out today they never activated the account so I have been charged almost 100 dollars every moth becaue I use my card so much. IÅfm out close to 1000 dollars because the clerk did not do her job and I have no way to prove it. DonÅft waste your time here
1,"TD Bank breached my privacy twice. First, they exposed my account to another party for over 3 years. Second, they gave my bank statements to another party without my consent. They deny the breaches, and refuse to give me the access history of my account. I am taking legal action against TD right now."
5,The staff at this branch are WONDERFUL every time!
2,most people here are not willing to serve!!!
5,"Had an amazing experience at TD with Miguel and Christian , give them a raise!!! Great service and professional staff. Will be back!"
1,"changing management in branches, they used to have wonderful staff whom helped all the way.new employee: new manager there is one of the worst customner service managers in banks i have ever seen, he solves client matters unprofessionally, after a bad attitude , lack of professional behavior, i informed him that im going to take my business else where his reply was"" good for u ""! he didn't have the knowledge to deal with a bank mistake of taking more than 4500 $ out of my account without my permission except of turning his face and leaving, only to come back with his awful negative energy that really made me change the bank. if you plan to keep him, please give him an extensive course in customer handling, he made me hate TD bank."
5,Incredible service and the employees that work here are the best! If only every TD Branch could be this good...
5,"I wanted to open a bank account today and had the pleasure to meet Andr?, an investment consultant at the branch. The experience was hands down, the best customer service IÅfve received at any bank - and IÅfve banked in Hong Kong and Australia. If youÅfre looking at TD branches, I definitely recommend going to this one over the others in town. Simple, friendly and most importantly, helpful. Literally made my day?? Thank you!"
3,"Luke is 5 stars! TD is 0 so I give them 3. Talk to Luke! HeÅfs by far the most knowledgeable and helpful person we have spoke to at TD. We recently moved all our daily banking accounts to a credit union. We were about to move our mortgage when we met Luke. He took the time to explain trends and also some recent moves TD made that enfuriated us. He was the fourth person we spoke to, everyone before him said Ågbecause we canÅh. Although you may too loath TD, if you have to deal with them speak to Luke! I only give them 3 stars because itÅfs TD. Luke gets 5 stars!"
5,They have provided great service for both my business and personal banking needs. All their staff are friendly and professional.
5,"I've been to mant TD banks in Downtown Toronto and found this one to deliver the best customer experience. Gizelda, the manager, is efficient."
5,staff are lovely
5,"I would like to thank Michelle! She's amazing! First of all, I returned a card that I found on the subway and she said they'll deal with it and second of all she helped me out with my bank draft issues that none of any td bank places would offer you a SOLUTION. She's very positive and helpful and I just want to appreciate her. Thanks again! ??"
1,Wish they would divest from the north dakota pipeline..
5,"I went there yesterday and was so happy with the service the branch provided me. The teller and manager went above and beyond their regular duties to ensure that my request was completed. I personally am not a TD client -family member is-but I sure hope that my branch gives me half the service that was provided to me by these two. I know that the surveyors won't call me, but they deserve an excellent rating!"
5,"Very good service, one of the managers, Ms. Ardashina, took the time to make sure That we solved my very complex problem. I'm happy I went to their location."
5,Great service and the staff very helpful and treat you like a somebody not just a customer
2,"I went to this location to close my mutual fund. First impression was great. I was welcomed and served when I entered the branch. The guy who was helping me at the counter seemed uncertain and just left the counter to talk to another employee. Which then I heard it was about my situation! It would have been better to inform the customer prior to leaving the counter! He wasnÅft able to help me that is why he booked me with one of their advis"
1,"Do not trust anything any of the staff tell you. We came in to close our credit cards to apply for new ones. When I asked the financial advisor Michael about what would happen to our points on the credit card we were closing, I was told by him that they would issue us a cheque with the balance of the points accumulated. Waited patiently for this cheque to come. It did not. After a few months decided to call TD VISA to ask about where this cheque was only for them to tell me that all the points i have accumulated are expired, because they expire after 3 months (also told by another person 90 days... well which is it?), and they would not help me. After paying fees for YEARS on this special credit card where I could accumulate points, and never redeeming them to save up, now I was told there was nothing they could do. Okay, well I'm closing all my accounts with TD, as well as credit cards because of this incident. HORRIBLE. Would never recommend TD to anybody."
5,I'm really impressed by the work ethic of the financial advisers at this branch. On a few occasions Michael went out of his way to offer help.
1,"This branch service is very terrible, special customer service manager Emily Yue is the worse ever service in this branch. I just askes her i need a prove letter that i was with TD bank , she refuced and she can not help this. Cos i m not with TD right now ."
5,Awesome
1,"no precise information on credit history, no clear answers to direct questions. different places tell you different things. Wish there was a place you could get reliable info from this bank"
4,"This branch is MUCH better than the liberty village location on Hanna. Staff are friendly, polite and wear their TD Pins and Name tags providing a professional atmosphere. Come here, avoid the LV branch if you want decent, attentive service from TD."
1,Friendly staff; lost our mortgage paperwork. I would avoid this branch.
5,I find this branch employees very helpful and accommodating to all my urgent needs.
5,"It was great experience with TD Bank. The account manager, Mr. Pandya explained about the canadian banking in very simplest way. I am glad that all my banking needs have been fulfilled in the most comfortable way. I strongly recommend this location."
5,The staff are very friendly and attentive! I'm terrible with my finances and am so happy that I had Mohit to guide me in the right direction toward better savings and reducing my debt. I highly recommend this location!
5,"Friendly staff, good location, and quick service. Team seemed well equipped to help & answer my questions"
4,"Great location, modern and up to date bank. They need to get wifi rolling here and all is well."
1,"Stay away business customers, this location is one of the worst I have been to in the GTA. Not worth the effort."
4,Good Staffs
2,"I can sincerely that this branch in particular, though the very rude, abrupt - crap attitude has spread to many branches. Those tellers are essentially twits. I think that tweeting has taken over their brains as they cannot conduct any business related conversation without - I will get back to you. and they never do. Its just frustrating, its insulting, as morons are managing your accounts. But the Customer service in Canada has gone to the dogs."
1,"They never ever answer their phone; they expect you to leave a message and they will call you back before the day end, but many times I've had my calls un-returned. This is very frustrating."
3,Ouf. At least the atms are never broken & its clean
1,This is the worst TD branch. There is always Åga problemÅh with some routine issue and the staff never know what to do about it. The rotating cast of managers just act like a deer in the headlight. They scheduled me for an appointment to open an account today. I rescheduled my whole team around it and then told me when I got there that they needed my passport. In the morning they told me a scan would work. On other occasions I would transfer $ to my US account and other branches would give a preferred rate if you were transferring a large sum. This branch has no idea how to do it. They struggle just to deposit cheques.
1,"Poor service. I'm not used to rude tellers, because every TD I have ever visited has amazing customer service! People also came in and cut in line, nothing was done. Male teller flirting with female customer and taking up far too much time."
1,"Terrible branch. IÅfve been here before about 2-3 years ago waiting in line for a female teller to finish flirting with a male customer before another was able to assist me. Little has changed this year. I bought British pounds and euros for my trip to europe in may 2019. For some reason as a bank, they were fully unaware that theyÅfve been selling withdrawn ten pound notes that arenÅft legally accepted in the UK since March 2018. I now have to exchange them at the bank of England when I return to London because apparently this branch doesnÅft carry the new one and would only convert it into CAD considering that I may lose money on conversion, which I will have to exchange back to pounds again for my next trip to London. Stay away from this branch!"
4,Dogs are allowed inside this bank location! They even give treats and will have water in a bowl in the summer time for the dogs. I will not leave my dog anywhere unattended so any place that understands ones fear of leaving a dog outside is awesome in my books. 4 out of 5 staff members are very friendly. Absolutely no complaints
1,Been using this branch for 9 years with my business. Disregarded by the current manager more than once. Twice he's refused to acknowledge me let alone help me - flipped me to his staff and walked away. Do not recommend - considering moving my business account to another bank.
5,"This branch has superbe customer service service They go above and beyond the call of duty Stephanie and Lin are awesome And there is free parking , Michael the Manager is FANTASTIC! He was of great help to me . He continued to follow up to make sure the problem had been fixed. I travel from Mississauga to do my banking at this location only!"
5,"I don't think I've met a more more thoughtful, diligent, and compassionate branch manager. Michael went out of his way to help me and my family, and continues to periodically check up to ensure we are still satisfied with our solutions. The customer service offered by Michael and his team is fantastic."
1,Extremely rude staffs.
1,"Change of management with no exciting customer experiences... had much better customer service at other branches. 
I was here 1.5 years ago and dealt with a guy at the business counter that delivered amazing customer service, but staff and management has changed."
1,Horrendous service.
1,"Joining in to all the other comments- this branch is by far the worst in all of Toronto! Have been trying to get a hold of the small businesa account manager for over a week- I came down in person, emailed and left multiple voice messages with no response. None of the front desk people are able to help either, and am now waiting over 5 hours for a call from the branch manager. This is also not the first time I've had to ""hunt down"" one of their account managers to get things moving along. Would stay away from this branch at all costs!!!!!!! Horrible service! Rude staff! Job doesn't get done!"
1,"This branch is rude and incompetent. Td bank overall has the worst service ever, they could not even complete a simple task such as updating basic info."
2,Branch always busy and always understaffed.
1,Tellers are free but they completely ignore you. There are customers who cut lines and they just ignored it entirely.
5,Excellent service! Staff is very friendly and are always saying hi to everyone who walks in.
5,"Always fantastic service, they greet you by your name, don't hold cheques. Very customer service oriented location"
3,"Service can be spotty at times, depending on the time of day. They no longer have a coin counter machine. They do have 30 minute parking spots around the building for your convenience."
1,"Terrible Terrible Service and extremely incompetent
Deposited some cheques and they put a hold on wrong accounts. When called to correct, very unresponsive. Extremely incompetent and unresponsive."
5,Conveniently located in the village and great customer service!
1,"I normally does not give reviews to Bank or other financial companies or organization but this I can't help it but to provide review of my awful experience at this branch of TD. I have unpleasant experiences with this branch, about three weeks ago I set up an appointment to see a financial advisor to open a RDSP account for my child, I phoned the branch, asked for requirements and the customer service just mentioned ID cards/SIN for myself and for my child, I asked if there is anything else that is needed and the lady said, ""no' that's all I need to bring with me. I walked in and the financial advisor started the application which at first she was hesitant coz I did not bring with me a card with my picture on it other than my OHIP however, I brought my citizenship certificate, after she went through the requirements from their website, she found out that my citizenship certificate is enough identification for myself. During the application, she found out that I need a copy of the CRA approval of the disability tax credit for my child, which I did not brought with me. I said to her, if I have known that the copy of the said letter from CRA is needed I should have brought it and get the application done and completed. I also mentioned to her that i phoned customer care few days before coming in to find out what are the requirements and that was not mentioned during my call. The application was hold off and she advised me to come back and bring the necessary. I wasted my one hour without having to get the application even half done coz it was not submitted at the time due to the missing documents. So phoned back on a Sat to rebook the appointment and the bank is open during Sat and I have never received a call back from the branch. I phoned back and set up an appointment. Went in and meet a different financial advisor, during the application he is insisting for me to open an account with TD so he could proceed with the application and I insisted no because I am happy with my financial institution and I said to the guy when I opened a registered account at TD I did not have any problem using a different bank in depositing funds on my account (by the way I closed those registered account with TD coz I charged my administration fee just after I open the account coz I am not within the maintaining balance for the account requirements, transferred my account to BMO Investorline instead) I insisted that he used my financial institution and application went thru no problem. So today before going into the branch I phoned their hotline number, verifying my account number and if it is good to deposit funds and ""Shane"" clarified my account and it is good to deposit. Went to the branch and waited in line and when I got to the teller she said she cannot the deposit the funds, she went and asked someone and when she came back she said she cannot deposit because ""maybe"" it is a new account and just recently opened that it is not yet in the system. I told the teller, I just phoned their hotline number and ""Shane"" said it is good to deposit, but the teller not able to help me or give me any answer to why I cannot deposit the funds, wasted another hour of my time, getting three kids to get to the branch and nothing happen. I was fuming, why such a big company cannot training their frontline staff to educate them about their service. I phoned the investment hotline number and I was told that I have to send the funds to their investment department. I have to say, even though I tried to open several account at this branch I never refer any of my friends and family to go and open accounts there, they are not very helpful. When I opened the RDSP for my child, the financial advisor has to call their investment department downtown to ask for some guidance. The guys excuse is it is their first time assisting a client with this type of account."
1,"I was told to pick up my card at this branch to show ID. The gentleman behind the counter took my ID entered something into his computer and told me I needed to call to have the card activated. I called, they said I needed to visit the branch to show ID. The call center agent tried his best to correct their error but in the end I had to go back in and got nothing but a jeez sorry in exchange for my wasted time. I'm not sure what sort of Mobius strip style process flow these clowns are running. TD Bank, I'm not impressed with my first interaction with you. Your branch staff, had one job and failed miserably."
1,"Seriously? I book an appointment, they cancel and say the representative called in sick, understandable. Re-schedule for next week, again get a call cancelling the appointment saying the employee called in sick. Suggested me to re-book again after a week with the same employee!! Guess TD doesnÅft value customer time. I need to block the weekend and wait for them to cancel. Please donÅft visit this branch, do yourself a favour. In competitive markets around the world, here we have bank that gives zero attention to helping its customers. Thanks, going to close my account with TD!"
5,"YOU GUYS- I went to a TD and... had fun while being at a bank?!? Like legit I felt like I somehow got my life together and made friends simultaneously. The staff at this branch are all like family, SUPER helpful, and lovely. Major shout out to Tunji (""TJ"") for the stellar advising, help, and just being incredible at his job. I'm only going to this branch from now on."
1,"This review is based on One entire full year of coming to this branch. I come here a few times a week. Having been to over 30 branches in Toronto and doing business banking at a commercial levelÅc I can confidently say that this is one of the worst branches I have been to in Canada where the level of service is below standard. There are only about a few competent staff members and they are not in the front. The front end staff is incredibly undertrained and many times make mistakes due to lack of experienceÅcMistakes as in, transferring funds from incorrect account/ Converting fees from wrong account/ Wire payment mistakes Åc even our access cards become deactivated as they switch around permissions with out checking the user profil"
5,Kim is always my favourite teller to go to. Helpful anf polite
1,Worst customer service ever. Extremely incompetent. I'm transferring to another bank because of this branch.
1,Extremely slow service waited in line for more than 25 minutes as they slowly with zero sense of urgency took care of 2 clients while a line formed out the door. It was as if they were trying to operate as slowly as possible.
1,"I would not recommend this branch to anyone. They never answer the phone, even if you do leave a voice mail no one will get back to you. They have given me false information and preceded to lie to my face. It took me over a month to get a checkbook when I was told it would take 15 day because I guess it's too hard to answer a simple voicemail. Disgusted and incompetent."
5,The customer service was spectacular! Thank you to Abegail and Kim.
1,"Worst service ever! They told me that I could not deposit a US cheque into my US account and refused. They treated me horribly. Later, branch manager Ms. Kathleen Le told me that it was MY fault due to miscommunication. Shame on them and I have no desire to bank with TD any further."
1,"No customer service here, I was treated poorly and would never use this location ever again."
1,"I have been using this branch for quite some time, and let me tell you, there is more than one reason to why you see a one star rating from me. Starting with their parking lot which is full of garbage and it's never clean, followed by the cash machines which are also always dirty. The staff doesn't really know how to deal with clients unless you are there just to pick up change or pay a bill. Don't expect anything else from this branch. There is obviously an issue here as they never managed to keep a manager working for longer than six months. Horrible bank. A Shame to Leslieville"
5,Great customer service from Kathleen Le! People like her deserve a shout out for excellent service. Thanks again!
5,"This is my home branch ever since I moved to the neighborhood 9 years ago. I love the service, the staff are very helpful and answer things quickly. There is parking which is awesome for me because I am always in a car. They even follow up on requests I leave at the branch. Special shout out to the ATMÅfs for always been available and full of cash!"
4,"Pretty standard TD. Can be busy, but never had any issues. ATM area clean & safe 24/7"
1,Banking should never be this UNCOMFORTABLE. I'm contacting the branch manager first thing Monday.
4,Yo this location is only open until 8pm THURSDAY & FRIDAY. Monday-Wednesday 6pm
4,Not busy on Monday mornings. Helpful staff. Clean. Feels safe when using the atm.
5,"I changed banks 11 months ago and am flabbergasted at how amazing the service I get is. 

Thanks to Kathleen in particular."
5,"Excellent staff, very professional. They are very busy at times, because they have so many customers, but they are thorough. Highly recommend... I've been using them for years now. Their new location is much nicer too."
5,"Excellent attention and quality of management, all the staff is very polite and meets all the requirements fast, successful you want them, Mariani International Tower Inc ... Happy Day From Canada July 1, 2016 ..."
3,Asked to get change for $100 dollars the lady ask me for my idea I didn't have it on my she refused to give me change.
5,"Staff are efficient, and friendly. Seem to ask too many questions about there promotions, but obviously it's doing their job, and doing it well."
1,This branch is understaffed and not trained properly. There is always a line and the staff struggles to complete wire transactions on a regular basis. Not the standard of service found at other TD branches.
5,The staff are almost too happy to be working at a bank. It must be their manager. They the best.
5,Great branch and staff
5,"I use this branch once in a while and it has never been busy.
The staffs are friendly."

5,Great experience! Friendly and knowledgeable staff!
5,"Not even my branch, but I use them frequently. I'll let my 5 Star review speak for it's-self."
1,Waited in line and finally reached to the counter. Nobody helped me. One of the lady told me to wait and never returned. They just called people behind me and helped them first. It's almost 20 minutes now
1,"I visited this branch yesterday (to get a bank draft), once it was established the draft was for a down payment on a house the conversation shifted in tone!

A staff member at the branch took a confrontational approach with me, asking why I didn't take a mortgage out with TD (I ended up trying to explain myself!)

Not only this, as I turned to leave I was informed (as if I had won the lotto!!) that I had been approved for a $23K line of credit and should the branch staff member proceed and activate the line of credit? Note this reader, I had made no mention of a line of credit during the time I had spent at the branch.

All this to say, it seems the 'Wolf in Sheep's Clothing' course is alive and well as part of TD's staff training curriculum!!"
3,"When this branch first opened, it was wonderful! Friendly, intelligent staff who recognized me in the bank and walking on the street. I always went to a teller and not to an ATM. Then something changed. Tellers were autonomous and their actions were completely scripted. I guess someone thought that longer operating hours and online banking can take the place of good service. So I stopped going in. I went in for the first time in a long time last month and received surprisingly efficient service. I'm going in again in a few minutes. I'll let you know............."
4,I've always found the staff friendly & courteous.
