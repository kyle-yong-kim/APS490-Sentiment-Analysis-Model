0,Love td bank and the tellers are so kind
0,"Not sure why this location received so many negative comments. I may be one of the few lucky guests? I had a good, efficient and friendly service."
1,This branch has one of the rudest customer representative IÅfve experienced with any bank. IÅfve been waiting ages for a new TD visa that IÅfve applied for and merely called the branch to check if theyÅfve received it. Is it really that much to ask to do a simple check? Instead I got a hostile woman acting like I have no right to even call and ask. There are many branches in the downtown area. Avoid this one if you can.
1,"If i have an option to put zero rate, i would do so. Absolutely horrible experience at this 394 bay st branch. The moment i walked in, it seemed i interrupted the conversation between the TD youge man and the inquiry desk person who told me her name is Margo, which on the tag seemed Margaret. She gave the attitude since then, wanted to kick me out from the first sec. I insisted having the appointment, which she gave me the next day 4pm. I asked for two general 800 numbers, one was for the back office, one was for the customer service, she refused me both, and told me you could find it on my card back. I've never seen anyone in my whole life who can be that rude, and negative. How bank allowed this kind of person stays, most important at the inquiry table."
1,"nice tellers. though, management in TD is a cry and shame."
1,"Worst TD IÅfve ever been to. As a trans person, they were not willing to help me add notes about the pending name change or anything to help me deposit chequeÅfs. Transphobic comments were made and I do not recommend their service to anyone."
0,Best branch
1,"I went to this branch twice. Both were absolutely horrible. The customer service people don't even know what they are doing. On the first instance, he screwed up my account by resetting my password while I was requesting it for a different account. In the second instance, CSR Briggite was helping me. She don't have any product knowledge. She couldn't answer any one of my questions and more over she was so rude to me. This bank should employ people who loves the job, who value Canadian culture. I will never ever go to this branch, if there is any alternative."
1,Absolute terrible service. Served someone who wasnt even in line while there was like 10 people in line. Seriously makes me consider changing banks
0,Good service
0,Newly renovated TD bank! Friendly staff.
1,"on April 22nd. I went to this branch to withdrawal money. I deposited coins and as usual I asked to have the same number of empty rolls for the future time. (usually i deposit empty rolls every week (around 400 dollars each time), since my particular job). I'm a client of TD since 2009. The girl at the desk told me that she was told to tell me that they couldn't give me empty rolls, I had to buy them a dollarama. I said that this never happened in 10 years of TD, and in no one branch they gave me that answer. Then she came back with few empty rolls and she said, ""this is what I can give you"". I I pointed out that many rolls were missing, no one of 1 or 2 dollars, etc.. she said, ""we need the empty rolls for our business"". I asked to talk with a manager. the manager is named Eduardo Brandao (I asked his business card). he confirmed that they use the rolls that they have for their business. this is a joke, I'm a client of TD, I'm bringing to them money since 10 years and this is not their business..? ridiculous, very disappointed by this."
0,the staff who assisted me was super friendly and helpful. the building itself is also beautiful and really comfortable to be in
0,"I have started using the bank branch regularly as I work in the area. I have had incredible experiences with all the levels of staff I have encountered and yet to have a bad experience. Their front desk staff are great. Personable, helpful, and curious. Their investment personnel are also more of the above. I have had numerous encounters when staff have been incredibly accommodating, working right up to and even past closing when they are supposed to be shutting down, and just going out of their way to find answers to complicated problems."
0,"Great bank branch. Very casual, modern and relaxed. Has a great view of the old city hall through the glass walls. The furnishing is more like a casual artsy cafe rather than a typical bank. A giant screen gives weather predictions and news headlines, tweets etc."
0,"I had an issue with my accounts that TD could not resolve for me for years. I went to this branch & Ayush, who was the branch manager came to help me. Not only did he help me with what I came in for, but helped resolve my issue after asking for my banking experience with TD. He was very professionally dressed & was always smiling. He's a keeper. I'll be banking with TD for a very long time. Thank you"
1,"Very upset! As an online entrepreneur, I have issues dealing with lunatics on a regular basis. It's the internet! The ""bank"" decided to block my account, based on the arbitrary word of an immigrant student who wanted me to cheat on his home work ..I am more the disgusted. After 4 hours of arguing and ZERO LEGAL ACTION, the jokers unlocked my account. Long story short...any idiot can get your account blocked with zero evidence and they will not even TELL YOU!"
1,"Extremely bad service. The staff left many waiting outside with the doors locked past the opening hours (9am), and were very unprofessional and cold, not to mention the lack of professional attire and character"
1,"I would give this location zero star if I had that option. I was at this branch yesterday to do some urgent banking and asked to speak with the manager and a young male came forward. My interaction with him was the worst I have experienced at any bank. I have been a loyal TD customer for 24 years. The manager's insincerity, unwillingness to help, defensive attitude and disrespectful tone was shocking and was more than enough for me to decide to move my entire portfolio to another bank. He definitley seemed not trained enough to deal with customers and unfit for a manager. I do not normally post public ratings but my experience was beyond disappointing which compelled me to write this review. I recommend avoiding this location."
1,"Horrible experience with the clerks, long waits AND they wouldn't even cash in my cheques!"
1,"Actually, i do not like to comment negatively, but what iÅfve experienced at that TD branch was sooo disappointed. I went there on thursday to open a bank account, i met one lady whom was in charge that day but (she seemed careless) yes, i didnÅft have an ID, she told me if i want i can comeback saturday with ID, i asked her if i do need an appointement, she said no you donÅft. Supresingly, i goback there today they told me that if i donÅft have appointement they can not help me, (obiviously that lady she wasnÅft there). Terrible service ever had, no customer care. Totaly they do not care about customers."
1,"I did a wire transfer and the bank teller didnÅft know where my checking or routing number is on my American check. In addition, he had no idea what my Swift code was and said this might work... I said no IÅfll call my bank in the USA and find it for SURE. He said umm ok cause if I get it wrong your wire would take two weeks. ItÅfs been two days no money - The wire is suppose to be delivered in 24 hours- SMH!!!!!!!!"
1,"The one asian guy at the front is as rude as it gets.. he didn't give me a form because ""there are alot of other customers in line""."
1,Branch looks really nice but staff also needs to be kind to TD customers.
1,"Everytime I come here, it is boiling. Youd think a major bank would have the money to blast AC to go along with there massive lines"
1,There is always long lines at this location. ItÅfs a big space with a lot of room to sit but seems a little unnecessary. Do patrons actually sit to hang out at a bank? IÅfve never seen it. There is access to the PATH of you go down the stairs.
1,Worst location ever!
1,"This branch is really really ridiculously slow. About one customer served by teller per 10 minutes. Have been here for 30 minutes, four active tellers"
0,"Sheresse, Manager Customer Service and team = A W E S O M E. TD CT's BEST Branch in downtown Toronto to Calgary, AB.."
0,Excellent banking service
1,Nice people but Beyond slow where there's a 15 meter line yet they don't bother calling the other employees to jump on when they were clearly free from downstairs.
1,1. Long wait time. 2. The Teller with a nose ring and the managers (Alyssa and Sheresse) were completely useless and they acted like they hated their jobs . Sheresse told me to hurry up with my transaction as she felt I was taking to long. She said that there are other people in line. She wouldn't allow me to close my bank account either. I will be moving to RBC or BMO in the Cert near future .
0,Excellent branch.
1,"EXTREMELY BLONDE HAIRED AND BRIGHT BLUE EYES TELLER LADY LIED STRAIGHT TO MY FACE WITH A SMILE..... went skating across the street at nathan phillips square, needed cash to pay & went to TD ... i tried to use the atm & took to long and it took my RBC debit card, when i informed the teller she seemed ready to assist me until she went to 3 staff members sitting at 1 desk drinking coffee at 9:45am who told her to tell me... they dont do that here i must go to my own branch and apply for a new card THIS WAS A STRAIGHT FACE LIE. (the friend i was with works at a TD!!!!) terrible to none customer service offered here Dec 7, 2017. not 1 person was in the line up behind and they refused to assist me"
0,Great customer service!
0,"Very cool looking td. It was little bit busy at lunch time, but pretty empty by 4 pm"
0,I don't leave reviews often but today afternoon I was taken care of by Renjie Lie at an exceptional level. He truly put customer service to a new meaning and went above and beyond in order to assist me to my best needs. Best of all the atmosphere in this banks branch alone is worth visiting and unlike any other TD Bank I've ever been inside of. Very futuristic vibe and design. Good work TD!
1,"This is the worst TD brunch in Toronto, they are rude horrible customer service, they yell at you, and they give you service as they want depend on their mood, THE MANAGER KASSANDRA MAUTI along with the teller EMMA refuse service and even when i was leaving i turn around and they were laughing at my back, stay away from this brunch with the most vicious service that anyone can offer! the reno doesn't do it"
1,No customer service. The manager Kassandra is rude. Stay away from this location.
0,Nice place. Friendly staff. Cozy and convenient. The only downside so far is a long line from time to time.
1,I always try to avoid the customer service people at this bank. Very rarely a good experience.
1,"So. Slow. Waited over 30 minutes to see a teller. 6 desk, only 2 were working."
0,"This is the best TD Trust downtown branch newly renovated and reopened this year. Glass like a green house full of light from all glass facade. An animated screen so huge across its wall near ceiling projecting people images, welcoming customers to enjoy banking. Cushioned seats at the front street level and down near The Path subway maze. Make yourself free coffee as a customer downstairs. The grass is greener on this side..."
1,"My experience in opening the investment account was disgusting. They lost my application and claimed their fax machine technical issue had been the cause!!, i was expecting more welcoming and customer care."
1,"I've come to this location multiple times because it is down the street from where I live and super convenient! That being said, this location has the worst wait time I've ever seen and with only 1-2 tellers during peak service times. For a new and large location, I've never experienced such bad service and timelines from entering to exiting the branch."
1,No Customer service. Long waiting and why they allow to chewing gum while talking to clients??
1,"Very bad customer experience, long waiting lines. New face of TD with bad customer relations."
1,"Trying to open an account took twice as long as projected due to representative forgetting to get a signature from me and then because of a discrepancy while entering my address. Every time I line up for the teller, I am amazed at how slow such a large branch can operate. Location's great, though."
0,Awesome experience with Oksana at the Welcome: Help and Advise desk
0,Awesome new branch - love the big screens and new ATMs. This is definitely the branch of the future. Definitely worth visiting if you are in the area.
0,Kassandra - the branch manager was super helpful in resolving my problem with the Credit Card. Exceptional Customer Service!
0,Was located at a great place
1,"I called in to TD recently to get my daily limit and transaction limits increased on my personal bank account so that I could buy some gold and silver. I was disappointed that TD routed me to a call center in India, which provided a degraded level of customer service due to the language and cultural barriers, as well as the distance. They said it was done and then I asked them to fix my mailing address, as the TD bank will amalgamate my mailing and physical addresses (which are in different towns), but the lady I was speaking to in India had no understanding of how to do that. I had previously requested this fix be made numerous times at my home branch, without them getting it done. I was then transferred to a Chinese bank rep out of Toronto who worked on it for awhile and claimed that he got it done, so we will see on the next letter I receive from TD. Anyways, going back to the issue with my transaction limit, when I got to the gold/silver shop a couple hours later I was only able to buy about half of what I had wanted to because of the incompetence of the bank rep in India, who didn't actually adjust my balance as she was supposed to. I then had to call back and was transferred to a manager in Canada who got it done at the touch of a key, but I still had to confront him about why they were using service reps on another continent to help Canadian customers, which obviously is being done to save them money, to the detriment on Canadian workers who should have those jobs. His response: ""I'm not prepared to have that conversation with you at this time."" TD should be ashamed of themselves for outsourcing customer service centers to places like India, which end up wasting their customers' time and giving us a bad experience."
0,"Regular TD experience, nothing special"
0,Good service.
1,"This is by far the worst branch in Toronto. Service is SO slow, the decor is horrible (ugly green plastic banner?!), the garbages are overflowing (at 9:30 AM, so I'm assuming we're never emptied at night) and there is literally garbage scattered across the floor. I'll make the trip to the Yonge & Adelaide location from now on."
0,It was really nice!! And so kind!!
1,"TD is the worst bank I've ever had the experience of dealing with. I've been a customer for 14 years and I was never treated as such. There were no relationships built despite trying to visit the same bank frequently. I was just someone that got pushed around because I'm in my twenties. Even in the main branch of Toronto, when I threatened to switch banks, the manager unflinchingly told me to, ""Go ahead."" -Hitesh Anand. Top notch customer service. As a business owner that takes on multiple single-job contracts from different clients, I receive my income in varying amounts from several sources. When I opened up a business account, I expected there to be a difference in the way holds were placed on deposits from personal accounts. Not here! The ONLY WAY for funds to not be held for 5 business days is to either get a wire transfer, or have it be a regular payment - as if it were a bi-weekly paycheque. Ignoring the first option because it's an inconvenience for clients, for the former - what free agent receives regular income from a source? That would be working for someone, not owning your own business. I have recieved multiple payments in the same amount from the same client a few times, but in no case was my money cleared right away because it wasn't ""regular enough."" It gets worse. After months of constantly being inconvenienced by this, I asked my client to write me a bank draft. I took it to my regular bank, and they held it because they said it might be fake. I asked if there was anything they could do and after an hour of hearing nothing, he said he'd fax the branch that issued the draft. When I came in the next day to check on the progress, the manager was not in, and didn't return my calls for 2 days. I kept calling every day until he finally let it clear ONE DAY EARLY. I should have switched banks at this point, but I figured I'd try to get the next portion of that payment as another bank draft - and maybe if I went to the same manager he would remember the last time and let it go. Was this the case? Of course not. I ask what I can do: call my client, call his bank rep, get a receipt of the draft? I was told if I did all three they *might* do it. I really needed the money, as did my employee, so I spent $100 in cabs getting all this stuff to get it in before the bank closed. After all of that, I still had to spend an hour arguing over it and it was all for nothing. Again, treated like a nobody while you take my money. I've even brought checks written out by Scotiabank themselves, and because they're never the same amount they never clear. I went to RBC today... and within 10 minutes I had an account, a representative that will personally look after my account and anything I need, and more importantly I deposited a cheque THE SAME DAY I MADE AN ACCOUNT AND IT CLEARED. TD Bank is terrible and I will never recommend anyone do business with you, nor will any of my other businesses and partners ever open an account with you. This post is just the beginning of my complaint."
1,There are so many people. . .
1,"This branch in particular is not student friendly. Once I moved downtown for school, I noticed a largely negative prejudice against students in all of the banks close to Spadina and Dundas. Unfortunately this is one of them. If you're a student trying to bank here or nearby- I wish you the best."
1,"Inexperienced staff, special Financial Advisor & TD customers service"
1,"As a business account holder, the service at this location is very inconsistent. Some days everything goes smoothly, while other days you come across new employees perhaps, who don't exactly know what they're doing so they only make your life a lot more exhausting."
1,Very limited service
1,"Here are 3 reasons TD is the worst bank for small businesses, based on my experience! 1- when I contacted TD to open a 3rd business account, I found out that they do not have my business information filed correctly, and items submitted are now missing from my file. These include vital business docs like my articles of incorporation. 2- I would expected that after escalating my issue to head office, and also provided missing documents, I've no more problems & get the account opened. But no, it took more than 2 weeks and my issue remains unresolved, and I haven't received an update in 5 days.Which makes me wonder, do they even care? 3- Throughout more than 7 interaction with TD employees I have found that they have not taken any responsibility for the error in losing my corporate documents, no one has even acknowledged the error. Yes, we all make mistakes, but I will not continue to work with a business that can't take ownership of their mistakes"
1,Worst Manager you can possibly come across. Wasted our time because he did not want to deposit our cheque. Walk down the street to the other branch they're way more helpful and competent. No issues there.
1,Your google page above says it's open on Sundays and when we arrived there Is a sign that says bank at the st clair location. Please update Google page to reflect correct hours and I'll delete review.
0,"Compared to the other TD branch across the street, this one is ten times better. Explained holding period properly, provided preper receipt and proof, and cared about its customers."
1,These guys are crooks. I closed out an account and they won't return a $150 credit that is owed to our business. NEVER USE TD BANK FOR BUSINESS IT IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE.
0,"Steven was SUCH a joy to work with. He walked us through every step of the process and made sure we understood what he was talking about. On top of that, he was super friendly and approachable."
1,Extremely long line
0,"Open late, which is great for me since I work late. There was a long line when I arrived at 7, but the wait was only around 10 minutes. The staff are really friendly and very efficient!"
1,Slow. Even with an appointment.
1,Should be a zero...worst customer service EVER! Arrived 15 mins before closing and they already closed their doors and told me and 10 other customers to beat it. Worker was rude and dismissive. By the looks of the reviews below this is a horrible bank location. Don't waste your time here.
1,"If I could give TD a zero I would. I have now reached out to my contacts at head office on the issues with the team there. Specifically Rohan Sachdev the mortgage specialist, what can I say unresponsive, unprofessional, hostile with his language and acts with a sense of entitlement like he is doing myself, my wife and our family a favour. I have documented laps of communications from him and also rude language in our emails. A customer of 25+ years and already moved our primary mortgage from there and looking now to move our corporate/small business accounts and all personal accounts by 2019. What a shame, who does the hiring of these people what a disaster. RBC btw has been amazing and white glove good bye TD!"
0,One of the best customer service experience I've had at a bank was with Customer Service Manager Tommy Wu. And this was when I was requesting to close an account. So patient and nice - wish people I was giving more business to were as great as him/this experience.
1,The worst td bank. Very slow. I do not recommend coming to this branch. Queen and spadina much faster service with more people working there. 5 min walk from this branch.
0,All the staff are great Asian people. I feel respect for the way how they serve to clients.
0,The tellers were really good at helping us out.
0,Their mortgage agent was able to help me get the mortgage I needed. Thanks.

0,"Haven't had any bad experiences here. The tellers are helpful and kind, and there are plenty of ATMs."
1,"Very long wait, all employees are Asian and slow. I waited 30 minutes in the line and they told me that they cannot give me a password to my online banking. Had to go to another TD"
1,"rude tellers with a chip on their shoulder!! i have family that works at td and this branch as put numerous comments on my account that are not true and is making my banking at TD a living hell!! no knowledge of services or how to use their systems(s3, c3 and admin apps) I felt no sense anyone wanted to help me"
0,The staff here are very patient and helpful.
1,"This TDÅfs front lobby smells like a pool, big thumbs up. Staff is nice when I had to get coins to do laundry. I like the carpet."
0,Appointments are are always delayed but the receptionist is a gem.
1,so slow
0,Really great service
0,Open late and has the friendliest staff of all locations I've frequented. Special thanks to Deravie for going for working extra hard to get what I wanted.
0,Very friendly and polite staff
0,Fast service. Large number of atms.
0,Becky at the Help & Advice desk was very friendly and helpful
1,"Consistently rude and dismissive with a passion for speaking over you. Spoke to a male manager at this location and never before has anyone showed such disregard for customer service. The kicker is him lying through his teeth about TD policies, changing the maximum withdrawal rate twice within a matter of seconds, thus proving he is lying about the rate. Never again will I come to this location. That was horrendous."
0,Fairly quick. Service in two languages.
0,Knowledgeable and quick
1,I like TD bank but this location is ridiculous. Transactions I make normally at other branches many times are not possible here. No reasoning.
1,"Terrible, absolutely not knowledgeable staff.I got a mail saying that I'm eligible for a credit limit increase and I came into this branch to accept the offer. A girl, who is one of the advisors at this location, said that I need to put a deposit to get an increase even though I currently have a credit card with TD without any deposits. Really?! I went to a different TD branch and it took seconds to do without any deposits. They were very surprised I was told I need to put a deposit."
1,currently in line. I have to pee with the fire of a thousand suns. bathrooms for internal use only and don't want to lose my place in line. all of the tellers seem as uneducated as their clients. no one is moving. one out of three tellers currently holding the crying baby of a customer. what is even happening.
0,I have a US account with TD. I use their ATMs with no foreign transaction fee or ATM fee.
0,"Fast service. Even with long lines, this branch does an exceptional job grinding through the lineup. Otherwise, the tellers are always friendly and the hours are excellent."
1,There is usually a wait here.
0,"This TD bank is big in size, also quite friendly, knowledgable and various fluent staff in Cantonese, Mandarin and English. They provide decent and fast service. Also, this TD bank has 4 ATM machines which is 2 more than the one at Queen and Spadina!"
0,Very helpful when I've used it previously. Usually there is a 10 min line up to see a teller but they're helpful once you see them.
1,"Manager does not honor what was promised. Very lengthy wait times And Unless you're oriental, you get terrible service."
1,Long lines and some of the employees can be very rude.
1,Rather slow service.
1,"Worst Customer Service, long waiting line. Offered me with high interest and annual fees for credit card without explaining various credit cards with no annual fees"
1,Terrible customer service ever! CSR was so unprofessional and impolite. The manager who came for his rescue was no different. In the name of prioritizing company policy they striped customer privacy. I would say Åefire yourselfÅf both CSR and the Manager either of you are fit for this job. TD needs to provide at least basic training to their front line employees especially at a location like this where most of your customers are professionals. No one has so much leisure time to deal with such a untrained bankers. Awful experience!
1,Highly untrained and unprofessional staff. DonÅft know answer to anything. Even the managers are not trained enough of the procedures. This is a prime location and customers are facing really bad service. Td bank needs to really work on training the staff if they need to stay in market.
1,"Worst customer service!!! I went to make cheque deposits. The teller didn't accept the deposit due $0.06 difference between amount in words and numbers. Some cheques with missing ""Inc."" on payee's name were not acceptable too. Don't go to this branch or better don't do banking with TD."
0,Great branch. Alex Korda was very helpful in setting up our mortgage. End-to-end service!
0,This is one of the main branches for TD Canada Trust. Great architecture and opulence. Lines move quickly. It is located inside BCE place and upstairs from Hockey Hall of Fame
1,"TD Canada Trust penalizes loyal customers!
I currently have a 5 year closed mortgage with 3 years remaining with TD Canada Trust.
I want to sell my home and purchase another home, 'porting' my mortgage.
Upon visiting the bank to find out what we can afford we have been told we need to qualify at 4.74%, even though we have a fixed rate mortgage at 2.89% with 3 years remaining. We were told we have to qualify at the higher rate because when our term is up the rates may be higher so TD wants to insure we can still pay.
But if I walk in off the street I only need to qualify at 2.89% or possibly even less - whatever product I choose. An absolute stranger with no history with TD and the bank has no concerns whatsoever that they will be able to pay one year hence.
The alternative presented was that we could choose to pay off the mortgage with a penalty of $11,347. If we did that we could qualify at any of the lower rates we choose just like a stranger off the street.
How does this make any sense? How is this not a complete slap in our face. We have been long term customers for decades with the TD and yet they are making us qualify at a higher rate than a complete stranger. Or pay an exorbitant penalty to get the same treatment as that stranger. How is this not discriminatory treatment, perhaps even blackmail against a loyal customer? "
0,"Timeless use of marble, woods, against a backdrop of light under the Brookfield Atrium. Harkens back to the old days of banking."
1,"worst custom service ever, worst manager Michelle"
1,"This bank truly has the worst customer service I've ever seen.
I've been doing business deposits for a year now and wait 20+ minutes every time I go . The woman at the business counter is usually the same one and she's horrible . She's incredibly slow , talks too much and holds up the line .

Definitely worth walking an extra 15 minutes to save you from the 30-40 min wait you'll do in the branch "
0,"Head office of TD Canada Trust. Nice, clean, business like. Classic Swedish inspired furniture throughout. "
1,"They don't provide you with your own information. Instead they give you an expensive 1-800 number to ring, which doesn't work. I've now got to take the afternoon off work, costing me money, just so I can get something that work have taken 5 minutes over the phone."

0,Good location. Very big inside
0,Great Customer Service!
0,One of Toronto's landmarks is very eye-catching.
1,"It's a good branch with courteous staff. But the financial advisors are terrible. They are simple not interested in helping. Spoke to someone about mortgage and he said he would work on it for me, send me an application and details and never got anything. He asked me to remind him.. Wow is it my job to remind him to email his customer? Pathetic and so unlike td reputation. Scheduled another appointment with someone else at this branch and this guy never bothered to contact. Best to go to Bmo and Scotiabank for better service with mortgage and better rates. Pointless being td's loyal customer I'm taking my business away"
1,"I have been misled 3 times when I called in to ask about the safety deposit boxes. They donÅft relay the correct hours in order to access the boxes over the phone and in person their customer service is absolutely horrible. JB was the person who I spoke with at the branch on my last visit, he told me to wait 2 hours, and was completely unsympathetic when I told him that I had been in a few times now and misled over the phone and he continued by saying that his manager would ÅgmaybeÅh be able to help me out. He mentioned that his managers priority were the tellers and not the customers. Fortunately another teller was able to help me out when he saw me standing and waiting for the manager. The manager never even addressed me. Unfortunately this is the closest bank to me which has safety deposit boxes available, I will continue to keep an eye out to see if other locations have one available so I can move branches."
1,"My experience with the mortgage ""specialist"" was not the best... I'm very new to the process and was really trying to know how much I can afford and ask about what the process is with the new mortgage incentives. 

- The person I had the appointment with was 20min late

- she wasn't really fully with me (checking her email for a deal and answering phone calls) .

- She told me that the incentives were available although it was too early since they only take effect in September (only found out this today)

- Everytime I ask a question she talks to me as if I'm trying to cheat the system or something ... I'm only trying to understand what I can do for my situation.

At the end she submitted a pre-approval request that was declined (internally based on what she told me) .... Because she didn't ask me about the proper information.

So I decided to go to another bank for my mortgage.

My advice is don't get an appointment using their online tool ...work with someone that's been recommended to you and has experience"
1,"Went here to discuss renewing mortgage and the customer service agent told us the advisor didnÅft want to talk to us! BMO gave a much cheaper mortgage rate!

Update: after this complaint, TD did match BMOÅfs competitive rate. Due to the initial bad experience and time wasted I have kept my review up."
1,These guys are crooks. I closed out an account and they won't return a $150 credit that is owed to our business. NEVER USE TD BANK FOR BUSINESS IT IS THE WORST EXPERIENCE.
0,A year ago a lady at this bank helped me replace my damaged bill for a new one. I remember she offered me great customer service by handling the situation with good sense of humor and being quite sympathetic and nice.
0,"Very friendly customer service
My atm card was not working they helped me to get through the process seamlessly truly a 20th century banking services"
1,Awful experience. Their best advice was to call the easy line. Spent more than 45 min waiting in line and waiting on a phone.
1,"By my estimation, TD is the most incompetent of the major Canadian banks. Support is slow and staff seem to have even worse training than RBC. I'm trying to get a business account closed and the process is going nowhere."
1,They wanted to put 11 days hold on my cheque even though the business routinely gets cheques and they always pass. The man at the business center was not helpful at all. They should'n't put people behind the desk that are afraid of dealing with big money. It's a bank afterall.
1,"Absolutely appalled with the ridiculous exchange fee I was charged to convert currency. On a 3.5K transaction I was charged over 10%. I phoned several times for an explanation since the fee was not explained when I signed off on it and nobody could explain how it was calculated. Bottom line is I feel like I've been robbed and completely forgotten despite my frustration. I have been a long time customer but to be honest, this along with several other issues I've had recently like the inept handling of my mutual funds and rrsp transfers And their lacklustre performance I am seriously looking for a new provider. Considering all the money I've handed over to this faceless corporation over the years being treated like a human and not just a source of revenue would be refreshing. Shame on TD."
1,"Got a money order without signature, went back and ask front desk, front desk asked me to line again said it wasn't their fault"
1,Very poor customer service experience from this specific branch.
1,Pretty bad experience multiple times. Sadly branch manager is not helpful either.

0,"I spoke with Remy today and what great customer service! It's nice to have friend, thorough, confident service!"
0,"Great tellers.

Had a bad experience with one of the FSM's.  

My mortgage application was declined when through this FSM, while I was accepted when I applied through a different FSM at a different branch."
1,After nearly 30 years as a TD client they treated me very poorly. RBC proved tremendously helpful and resolved the issue.
0,"The last major work by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the TD Centre is one of the (few) great structures in the Toronto skyline."
1,Horrible bosses.
1,this bank teller needs attitude adjustment classes. this young asian woman.
1,Didn't have what I needed and offered no alternative solutions to assist me. I consistently get good customer service with TD and was surprised by this negative experience.
0,Several ATM's to use.Friendly staff.
0,fancy place
0,Very friendly staff.
